<brief>Assignment of geometry axis to channel axis</brief>
<description>This MD is used to specify which channel axis the geometry axis is assiged to. Each geometry axis must be assigned to a specific channel. If a geometry axis is not assigned to a channel axis, then this geometry axis is not available, and cannot be programmed (with the name defined under MD20060 $MC_AXCONF_GEOAX_NAME_TAB).

For example: Turning machine without transformation:
MD20050 $MC_AXCONF_GEOAX_ASSIGN_TAB[ 0 ] = 1  ; 1st geometry axis = 1st channel axis
MD20050 $MC_AXCONF_GEOAX_ASSIGN_TAB[ 1 ] = 0  ; 2nd geometry axis not defined
MD20050 $MC_AXCONF_GEOAX_ASSIGN_TAB[ 2 ] = 2  ; 3rd geometry axis = 2nd channel axis

The assignment made here is valid if no transformation is active. With active transformation n, the transformation-specific assignment table MD24... $MC_TRAFO_GEOAX_ASSIGN_TAB_...  becomes active.

<brief>Geometry axis name in channel</brief>
<description>This MD is used to enter the names of the geometry axes separately for each channel. Geometry axes can be programmed in the part program using the names specified here.

Special cases:
- The geometry axis name entered must not conflict with the designations and assignments of the machine and channel axis names or other identifiers.
 Names for Euler angles (MD10620 $MN_EULER_ANGLE_NAME_TAB),
 Names for direction vectors (MD10640 $MN_DIR_VECTOR_NAME_TAB),
 Names for intermediate circle point coordinates for CIP (MD10660 $MN_INTERMEDIATE_POINT_NAME_TAB) and the
 Names for interpolation parameters (MD10650 $MN_IPO_PARAM_NAME_TAB) coincide.

- The geometry axis name entered must not include any of the following reserved address letters:
	- D Tool offset (D function)                     - E Reserved
	- F Feedrate (F function)                        - G Path condition
	- H Auxiliary function (H function)            - L Subroutine call
	- M Miscellaneous function (M function)  - N Subblock
	- P Subroutine number of passes            - R Arithmetic parameters
	- S Spindle speed (S function)                 - T Tool (T function)

- The name must not include any keywords (e.g. DEF, SPOS etc.) or pre-defined identifiers (e.g. ASPLINE, SOFT).
- The use of an axis identifier consisting of a valid address letter (A, B, C, I, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) followed by an optional numerical extension (1-99) gives slightly better block change times than a general identifier.
- Identical names may be given to geometry axes assigned to different channels.

<parameter number="20070" type="BYTE" dim="1">
<name>AXCONF_MACHAX_USED</name>
<brief>Machine axis number valid in channel</brief>
<description>This MD is used to specify the machine axis which the channel axis/special axis is assigned to. Each channel axis has to be assigned to a specific channel. A machine axis that has not been assigned to a channel is inactive, i.e. the axis control is not computed, the axis is not shown on the screen, and it cannot be programmed in any channel.

From software version 5, a machine axis need not be assigned to a channel axis for reasons of uniform configuration. The MD for the machine axis is set to 0 in this case. At the same time, MD11640 $MN_ENABLE_CHAN_AX_GAP must be set to 1 (channel axis gaps are permitted).

From software version 5, the machine data MD20070 $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED does not directly refer to the machine axes created with MD10000 $MN_AXCONF_MACHAX_NAME_TAB, but to the logical machine axis map which is defined with MD10002 $MN_AXCONF_LOGIC_MACHAX_TAB.

MD10002 $MN_AXCONF_LOGIC_MACHAX_TAB refers:
- directly to a local machine axis on the NCU,
- to a machine axis of another NCU in the NCU grouping or
- indirectly to an axis container with local or remote machine axes.

If the default values AX1, AX2, ..., AX31 are entered with MD10002 $MN_AXCONF_LOGIC_MACHAX_TAB, then the NCK behaves in the same way as up to software version 4, this means that machine data MD20070 $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED refers to the corresponding local machine axis.

Special cases:
- Each geometry axis must be assigned to a channel axis and a machine axis so that it can be programmed.
- If a machine axis is assigned to several channels by means of MD20070 $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED, then the number of the channel from which the axis is to be programmed must be entered in MD30550 $MA_AXCONF_ASSIGN_MASTER_CHAN.
- Up to software version 4, the list of entries must not contain any gaps (as from software version 5 - see above). In contrast, the assignment of the machine axes used may contain gaps.

For example:
Permissible:
	AXCONF_MACHAX_USED [0] = 3; 3rd MA is the 1st axis in the channel
	AXCONF_MACHAX_USED [1] = 1; 1st MA is the 2nd axis in the channel
	AXCONF_MACHAX_USED [2] = 5; 5th MA is the 3rd axis in the channel
	AXCONF_MACHAX_USED [3] = 0

Error for software version 4, permissible for version 5:
	AXCONF_MACHAX_USED [0] = 1; 1st MA is the 1st axis in the channel
	AXCONF_MACHAX_USED [1] = 2; 2nd MA is the 2nd axis in the channel
	AXCONF_MACHAX_USED [2] = 0; gap in the list ...
	AXCONF_MACHAX_USED [3] = 3; ... of the channel axes

Axis identifiers must be defined in the corresponding list places of AXCONF_CHANAX_NAME_TAB for the axes activated in the channel.

FALSE

The contents of the address extensions of the NC addresses T and M 'tool change command number' are not evaluated by the NCK. The PLC decides on the significance of the programmed extension.

TRUE

The address extensions of the NC addresses T and M 'tool change command number' - 'tool change command number'=TOOL_CHANGE_M_CODE with 6 as the default value - are interpreted as spindle numbers.

The TM must know on which tool holder a tool has to be loaded.

Then, the numbers $TC_MPP5 are no longer regarded as spindle numbers but as tool holder numbers.
The automatic address extension of T and M=6 is then the value of this machine data, and no longer the value of MD20090 $MC_SPIND_DEF_MASTER_SPIND.
The MD defines the master tool holder number to which a tool preparation or a tool change refers.
Reference is also made to this value for the determination of the tool on the tool holder for the setting 'retain old offset' of MD20110 $MC_RESET_MODE_MASK.
If a machine has several tool holders but no defined master spindle, then the MD serves as a default value for determining the tool holder on which the tool is to be loaded during a tool change (reset, start, T='identifier', M6).

When defining the magazine locations of internal magazines (see documentation for TM), locations of the type 'SPINDLE' - $TC_MPP1=2 = spindle location can be given a 'location kind index' ($TC_MPP5). This assigns the location to a specific tool holder.
The tool holder with the number n can be declared the master tool holder with the language command SETMTH(n). That is, the offsets of a tool, which is loaded in a provisional buffer storage location of the type 'SPINDLE', correct the tool path with the value $TC_MPP5=n.

Tool changes on 'SPINDLE' locations with $TC_MPP5 unequal to the number of the master tool holder do not influence the path.
The tool holder defined in the MD is again declared as the master tool holder with SETMTH.

<brief>Error handling for function CUTMOD</brief>
<description>When function CUTMOD becomes active (through explicit call or tool selection), various error conditions may occur. For any of these error conditions it is possible to use this machine data to set whether the error shall trigger an alarm and, if so, whether such an alarm shall only be displayed (warning) or whether the interpretation of the part program shall be canceled.
Two machine data bits are assigned to each error condition (also see the description of alarm 14162).
The 2nd bit, which can be used in the case of an error to set that the part program interpretation should be interrupted, is only effective, if the associated 1st bit (display) of an alarm is also set.

<brief>Tool change commands to PLC after search run</brief>
<description>This MD is only relevant with active magazine management (MD18080 $MN_MM_TOOL_MANAGEMENT_MASK, MD20310 $MC_TOOL_MANAGEMENT_MASK).
It defines whether or not tool change commands, tool preparation commands (tool change commands in general) are output to the PLC after block search with calculation.

1:	Tool change commands, tool preparation commands are collected and, after reaching the search target, output to the PLC with program start.
0:	All tool/magazine-specific commands that have been collected during the block search are not output to the PLC with the subsequent program start! This means that programmed POSM, TCI, TCA commands are not output either.

Note 1:
Without active magazine management, the tool change M code is not collected if it is not assigned to an auxiliary function group. With active magazine management, this corresponds to MD value = 0.
Note 2:
Value = 0 is appropriate if, for example, after reaching of the search target, the collected tool change commands are output to the PLC in an ASUB by means of the GETSELT, GETEXET commands.

<brief>Reset response of G groups</brief>
<description>This MD is only evaluated if bit 0 is set in MD20110 $MC_RESET_MODE_MASK.
For each entry in MD20150 $MC_GCODE_RESET_VALUES (that is for each G group), this MD is used to determine whether, on reset/part program end, the setting in MD20150 $MC_GCODE_RESET_VALUES is used again (MD = 0) or the current setting is retained (MD = 1).

Example 1:
Here, the basic setting for the 6th G group (current plane) is read from MD20150 $MC_GCODE_RESET_VALUES at each reset / part program end:
MD20150 $MC_GCODE_RESET_VALUES[5]=1 ; reset value of the 6th G group is G17
MD20152$MC_GCODE_RESET_MODE[5]=0 ; after reset / part program end, the basic setting for 6th G group corresponds to MD20150 $MC_GCODE_RESET_VALUES[5]

However, if the current setting for the 6th G group (current plane) is to be retained after reset / part program end, then the following setting results:
MD20150 $MC_GCODE_RESET_VALUES[5]=1 ; reset value of the 6th G group is G17
MD20152 $MC_GCODE_RESET_MODE[5]=1 ; current setting for the 6th G group
;is retained even after reset / part program end.

Example 2:
Here, the basic setting for the 8th G group (work offset) is read from MD20150 $MC_GCODE_RESET_VALUES at each reset / part program end
MD20150 $MC_GCODE_RESET_VALUES[7]=2 ; Reset value of the 8th G group is G54
MD20152 $MC_GCODE_RESET_MODE[7]=0 after reset / part program end, the basic setting for the 8th G group corresponds to MD20150 $MC_GCODE_RESET_VALUES[7]
If G54 was already active, especially at the time of reset, the values of the corresponding data handling frame at the time of reset are activated.

However, if the current setting for the 8th G group (work offset) is to be retained after reset / part program end, then the following setting results:
MD20152 $MC_GCODE_RESET_MODE[7]=1 ; if a work offset (e.g. G54) was active at the time of reset, then the values of the corresponding data handling frame at the time of reset are activated (that is UIFR[1] with G54)

The changing of the initial setting of individual G groups can be disabled for specific systems.

In this way, the the compressors COMPON and COMPCURV may limit the compression of the path axes.
Compressor COMPCAD acts differently: It ignores changes to the F word as long as they lie below the threshold defined by COMPRESS_VELO_TOL. If the feed programmed in a block changes more than COMPRESS_VELO_TOL, COMPCAD interrupts the compression at this block transition so that the feed change takes place at exactly the desired position.

<name>TOCARR_ROTAX_MODE</name>
<brief>ToolCarrier: rotary axis setting with axis positions not defined</brief>
<description>The MD is bit-coded. Bit 0 applies to orientable tool holders with one axis, bit 1 for those with 2 axes.
When the axis positions of an orientable tool holder are determined from a specified frame, it may happen that the required orientation is achieved at any position of a rotary axis.
 This MD specifies how the rotary axis position is defined in these cases:
 If the relevant bit is 0, the position of the rotary axis will be 0; a possibly necessary rotation is performed through the specified frame.
 If the relevant bit is 1, the rotation is performed by means of the rotary axis of the orientable tool holder. The resulting frame will no longer include a rotation.
Example:
A tool in its basic position points into the Z direction, and an axis of the orientable tool holder rotates the workpiece around Z (C_Axis). If the tool is to be oriented parallel to the Z axis of a rotating frame, and if the frame only rotates around the Z axis, the tool orientation will not be changed if the C axis is rotated. The condition stating that the tool is to point in the direction of the Z axis defined by the frame is therefore fulfilled for any position of the Z axis.
Bit 2: If this bit is set, the value 1 is output in the system variable $P_TCSOL as the number of solutions in a singular position for which there is one unique solution because of the alignment with the vertical coordinate axes perpendicular to the orientation. If this bit is not set, two solutions are output (the angles around the orientation axis differ by 180 degrees). This variant is required for compatibility with older software versions.

<description>In the case of smooth approach and retraction, the point defined with DISCL, from which, in the case of infeed from the initial plane, traversing is carried out at lower speed (G341) or the point in which the actual approach movement begins (G 340), must lie between the initial plane and the approach plane.

If this point lies outside this interval and the deviation is less than or equal to this machine data, it is assumed that the point lies in the approach or retraction plane.

If the deviation is greater, then alarm 10741 is output.

Example:
An approach is made from position Z = 20. The SAR plane is at Z = 0. The point defined by DISCL must therefore lie between these two values. If it lies between 20.000 and 20.010 or between 0 and -0.010, it is assumed that the value 20.0 or 0.0 was programmed (under the condition that the MD has the value 0.010).

<name>CUTCOM_MAX_DISC</name>
<brief>Maximum value for DISC</brief>
<description>The G450 transition circle cannot produce sharp outer contour corners, because the path of the tool center point through the transition circle is controlled so that the cutting edge stops at the outer corner (programmed position).
Where sharp outer corners are to be machined with G450, the DISC instruction can be used in the program to program an overshoot. This transforms the transition circle into a conic section and the cutting edge lifts off from the outer corner.

The value range of the DISC instruction extends from 0 to theoretically 100 in steps of 1.
DISC = 0      ...Overshoot disabled, transition circle active
DISC = 100  ...Overshoot large enough to theoretically produce a
               response similar to intersection (G451).

Programmed values of DISC which are higher than those stored in CUTCOM_MAX_DISC are limited to this maximum value without output of a message. A severely non-linear alteration in the path velocity can thus be avoided.

Special cases:
	It is not generally meaningful to enter values higher than 50 in DISC.
	It is therefore not possible to enter values &gt; 75.

<description>Where outer corners are very flat, G450 (transition circle) and G451 (intersection) approximate each other more and more. In such a case, it is no longer useful to insert a transition circle. Especially with 5-axis machining, it is not allowed to insert a transition circle at these outer corners, as this might lead to losses in velocity during continuous-path mode (G64).

That is why the system switches automatically from G450 (transition circle, possibly with DISC) to G451 (intersection) in the case of very flat outer corners. The contour angle (in degrees), as of which the automatic switchover (transition circle ---&gt; intersection) is to be carried out, can be specified in CUTCOM_CURVE_INSERT_LIMIT.

Bit 17=1: Tool life decrementation can be started and stopped via the PLC in channel DB 2.1...DBx 1.3.
Bit 18=1: Activation of monitoring of "Last tool in the tool group"
Bit 18 Lengthens the search for a suitable tool, above all, when there are a large number of disabled replacement tools.
Bit 18=0: No monitoring of "Last tool in the tool group"
Bit 19=1: The synchronizations determined by bits 5...8 refer to the main run block. This means that the block change is delayed until the required acknowledgments have been received.
Bit 19, in conjunction with set bits 5, 6, 7, 8, delays block processing.
Bit 19=0: The synchronizations determined by bits 5...8 refer to the tool command output. This means that the block change is not delayed.

Bit 20 to bit 24
Bit 20=0: If the PLC signal "Program test active" is present, then the commands generated are not output to the PLC. The NCK acknowledges the commands itself. The magazine and tool data are not changed.
Bit 20=1: If the PLC signal "Program test active" is present, then the commands generated are output to the PLC. Depending upon the type of acknowledgment, tool/magazine data can be changed in the NCK. If the acknowledgment parameters for the "target magazine" are given the values of the "source magazine", then there is no tool transport, and thus also no data change in the NCK.
Bit 21=0: Default setting: Ignore the tool state "W" during tool selection.
Bit 21=1: Tools in the state "W" cannot be selected by another tool change/tool preparation command.
Bit 22=1: Function "Tool subgroups"
$TC_TP11[x] is the grouping or selection parameter
Bit 23=0: Default setting
The tool management selects the tool optimally and safely in the main run. This means that the interpreter may have to wait until the end of the tool selection for the offset selection.
Bit 23=1: For simple applications
The interpreter selects the tool itself. This means synchronization with the main run is not required for the offset selection. (However, an uncorrectable alarm may be issued if a tool becomes unserviceable after selection but before loading.)
Note: Bit4=1 (PLC can reject tool) and Bit23=1 (interpreter selects tool) are mutually exclusive.
Bit 24=0: Default setting
If the PLC commands 8 and 9 (asynchronous transfer) want to move a tool to a location reserved for another tool, then this is rejected with an alarm.
Bit 24=1: If the PLC commands 8 and 9 want to move a tool to a location reserved for another tool with "Reserved for tool from buffer" (bit value= "H4"), then this is possible. This location reservation is removed before execution of the motion ("Reserved for new tool to be loaded" (bit value= "H8") remains effective).

Bit no. meaning when bit is set
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bit 0: (LSB):
	For turning and grinding tools, the wear parameter of the transverse axis is included in the calculation as a diameter value.
Bit 1:
	For turning and grinding tools, the tool length component of the transverse axis is included in the calculation as a diameter value.
Bit 2:
	If a tool length correction is included in the calculation as a diameter value, the tool may only be used in the plane that was active when the tool was selected. If this bit is set, a plane change leads to an alarm.
Bit 3:
	Work offsets in frames in the transverse axis are included in the calculation as diameter values.
Bit 4:
	PRESET value is included in the calculation as a diameter value
Bit 5:
	Include the external work offset in the transverse axis in the calculation as a diameter value
Bit 6:
	Read actual values of the transverse axis as diameter values (AA_IW, AA_IEN, AA_IBN, AA_IB. Notice: Not AA_IM.)
Bit 7:
	Display all actual values of the transverse axis as diameter values, irrespective of the G code of group 29 (DIAMON / DIAMOF)
Bit 8:
	Always display the distance-to-go as a radius in the Work (WCS)
Bit 9:
	During DRF handwheel travel of a transverse axis, only half the distance of the specified increment is traveled (on condition that MD11346 $MN_HANDWH_TRUE_DISTANCE = 1).
Bit10:
	Activate the tool component of an active, orientable tool holder even if no tool is active.
Bit11:
	The tool parameter $TC_DP6 is not interpreted as a tool radius but as a tool diameter.
Bit12:
	The tool parameter $TC_DP15 is not interpreted as wear of the tool radius but as wear of the tool diameter.
Bit13:
	During JOG of circles, the circle center coordinate is always a radius value, see D42690 $SC_JOG_CIRCLE_CENTRE.
Bit14:
    Absolute values of the transverse axis with cycle screenforms in the radius
Bit15:
    Incremental values of the transverse axis with cycle screenforms as diameter
Bit16:
	For GWPS (GWPSON/TMON), the tool parameters, tool length, wear and base dimension, are interpreted as diameter values
Bit17:
	With cutting edge position compensation (CUTMOD) for turning and grinding tools, the cutting plane for calculating the compensation values is rotated into the machining plane. If this bit is not set, the cutting edge is projected into the machining plane instead.
Bit18:
	With cutting edge position compensation (CUTMOD) for turning and grinding tools, always use the active plane (G17 - G19). If this bit is not set, the plane specified by setting data SD42940 $SC_TOOL_LENGTH_CONST has priority over the plane specified by the G code group 6 (plane selection, G17 - G19).
Bit19:
	The tool orientation change caused by an orientable tool holder becomes effective even if no tool is active. This bit is only effective if bit 10 is also set.
Bit20:
	If this bit is zero, and if the tool parameter $TC_DP10 (holder angle) and/or $TC_DP24 (clearance angle) contain the value 0, the following default values are used as the basis for the function CUTMOD to calculate the modified cutting-edge position and the modified cutting-edge direction:
	Holder angle 112.5 degrees for cutting-edge positions 1 - 4
	Holder angle 67.5 degrees for cutting-edge positions 5 - 8
	Clearance angle 22.5 degrees for cutting edge positions 1 - 4
	Clearance angle 67.5 degrees for cutting-edge positions 5 - 8
	If this bit is set, an alarm is output in the cases mentioned. This bit is used to establish compatibility with older software releases.
Bit21:
	If this bit is zero, any existing rotation in the part proportion of the tool carrier is taken into account for CUTMOD with tool carrier when modifying the cutting edge position. Frames are ignored.
     If this bit is 1, in the place of the part proportion of the tool carrier, the active total frame is taken into account with CUTMOD with tool carrier with modification of the cutting edge position. The total frame can also contain a part proportion of the tool carrier.
Bit22:
	If this bit is zero, with an active kinematic transformation, a wear component of the tool that cannot be transformed (see SD42935 $SC_WEAR_TRANSFORM) is taken into account statically with the position of the transformation that was valid at the time of the tool selection.
	If this bit is 1, with an active kinematic transformation, a wear component of the tool that cannot be transformed (see SD42935 $SC_WEAR_TRANSFORM) is taken into account in real-time with the relevant current position of the transformation.

1.0 means that the IPO buffer control, with full IPO buffer continues to control the path feedrate, and therefore avoids the IPO buffer becoming empty faster. This results in minor fluctuations of the IPO buffer fill level. However, a longer machining time must be expected.

<brief>Mode of orientation smoothing</brief>
<description>The mode of operation of orientation smoothing with ORISON can be set with this MD.
The units, tens, hundreds and thousands digits have different meanings.
The following possibilities are available:

The units digits of this data define the type of smoothing: rotary axis or vector smoothing.

xx0: The type of smoothing is defined by the active G code of the 51st G code group:
        ORIAXES active: rotary axis smoothing, ORIAXES inactive (e.g. ORIVECT): vector smoothing.

xx1: Vector smoothing irrespective of the active G code of the 51st G code group

xx2: Rotary axis smoothing irrespective of the active G code of the 51st G code group


The tens digits can change the effect of the smoothing:

x0x: Smoothing takes place along the entire path length.

x1x: Smoothing takes place homogeneously along the traversing length of the orientation axes.

x2x: Tolerance changes become active block-synchronously. In the other case, a change of tolerance becomes active incrementally over a defined path length. As a rule, this leads to a more homogeneous progression of the orientation. This setting option only plays a role if the blocks are subdivided (hundreds digit of this machine data 1xx). If the blocks are not subdivided, any tolerance change always becomes active block-synchronously.


The hundreds digits can be used to set whether the smoothing works on the programmed original blocks or on suitably split blocks:

0xx: The programmed blocks are not subdivided. The effect of the orientation smoothing is very dependent on the programmed block structure.

1xx: The programmed blocks are subdivided so that the orientation smoothing can generate a homogeneous progression of the orientation.
        Only those blocks are subdivided, in which a compressor (COMPCAD, COMPCURV, COMPON) is active.

2xx: The programmed blocks are subdivided so that the orientation smoothing can generate a homogeneous progression of the orientation.
        All program blocks are subdivided, irrespective of whether a compressor (COMPCAD, COMPCURV, COMPON) is active in it or not.


The thousands digit can be used to set how the tolerance is specified for the orientation smoothing:

0xxx: The tolerance is specified according to the usual rules. This means that when OTOL = &lt;...&gt; is programmed, the value thus programmed becomes active, otherwise the value of SD $SC_ORISON_TOL becomes active. The G0 tolerance factor is always
          calculated in (value of MD20560 $MC_G0_TOLERANCE_FACTOR or the value programmed with STOLF = &lt;...&gt;.

1xxx: The tolerance is always specified with SD42678 $SC_ORISON_TOL, irrespective of whether OTOL = &lt;...&gt; was programmed.

2xxx: The G0 tolerance factor is not included in the calculation. This is the case both for the tolerance specified with OTOL = &lt;...&gt; as well as with SD42678 $SC_ORISON_TOL.

The two numerical values can be combined with one another.

<name>SMOOTHING_MODE</name>
<brief>Behavior of smoothing with G64x</brief>
<description>Configuration of smoothing with G641 and G642 or G643.
The MD is decimal-coded. The units digits define the response with G643, and the tens digits the response with G642. The hundreds digit can define whether, with G641 or G642, the axes may be accelerated within the smoothing range or traversed at constant velocity. The thousands and ten-thousands digits are used to configure smoothing with G644.

x0:	G643 uses axis-specific tolerances; these are set with the axis-specific MD33100 $MA_COMPRESS_POS_TOL.
x1:	G643 uses the contour tolerance SD42465 $SC_SMOOTH_CONTUR_TOL for smoothing the geometry axes. The axis-specific tolerances in MD33100 $MA_COMPRESS_POS_TOL are used for smoothing all other axes.
x2:	The angular tolerance SD42466 $SC_SMOOTH_ORI_TOL is used for smoothing the orientation movement. The axis-specific tolerances in MD33100 $MA_COMPRESS_POS_TOL are used for all other axes.
x3:	Combination of the two options 01 and 02. This means that G643 uses the tolerances SD42465 $SC_SMOOTH_CONTUR_TOL and SD42466 $SC_SMOOTH_ORI_TOL. All other axes are smoothed with an axis-specific tolerance.
x4:	G643 uses the smoothing length programmed with ADIS= or ADISPOS=. The specification of possible axis-specific tolerances or contour and orientation tolerances is ignored.

0x:	G642 uses axis-specific tolerances; these are set with the axis-specific MD33100 $MA_COMPRESS_POS_TOL.
1x:	G642 uses the contour tolerance for smoothing the geometry axes. The axis-specific tolerances in MD33100 $MA_COMPRESS_POS_TOL are used for smoothing all other axes.
2x:	The orientation movement with G642 is smoothed using the angular tolerance SD42466 $SC_SMOOTH_ORI_TOL. The axis-specific tolerances in MD33100 $MA_COMPRESS_POS_TOL are used for smoothing all other axes.
3x:	Combination of both options 10 and 20. This means that G642 uses the tolerances SD42465 $SC_SMOOTH_CONTUR_TOL and SD42466 $SC_SMOOTH_ORI_TOL. Other axes are smoothed with an axis-specific tolerance.
4x:	G642 uses the smoothing length programmed with ADIS= or ADISPOS=. The specification of possible axis-specific tolerances or contour and orientation tolerances is ignored.

Possible values of the hundreds digit (specification of path velocity for smoothing):

0xx:        A profile of the limit velocity is calculated within the smoothing range from the specified maximum values for acceleration and jerk of the axes or path involved. This can lead to an increase in
               path velocity in the smoothing range and consequently to an acceleration of the axes involved.

1xx:        A profile of the limit velocity is not calculated for smoothing blocks with G641. Only a constant limit velocity is specified. In the case of smoothing with G641/G642, this prevents the axes involved accelerating in the
               smoothing range. However, this setting may lead to smoothing blocks being traversed at a velocity that is too low, especially in the case of long smoothing ranges.

2xx:        No velocity profile for G642 and G645 (see the above scenario for description).

4xx:        The "effective" path velocity in a smoothing block will remain constant, if possible, as long as the dynamic response of the axes permits this. Unlike the default setting, the smoothing blocks are also interpolated as a path with this setting.

Possible values for the thousands digit (configuration of G644):

0xxx:
	When smoothing with G644, the maximum deviations of each axis specified in MD COMPRESS_POS_TOL are adhered to. If the dynamic response of the axis allows, the specified tolerance may not be fully utilized.
1xxx:
	When smoothing with G644, the smoothing distance is specified.
2xxx:
	When smoothing with G644, the maximum frequency at which the smoothing movement of each axis occurs is limited. The maximum frequency is specified in MD32440 $MA_LOOKAH_FREQUENCY.
3xxx:
	When smoothing with G644, neither the tolerance nor the smoothing distance is monitored. Each axis traverses around a corner with the maximum possible dynamic response. With SOFT, both the maximum acceleration and the maximum jerk of each axis are observed. With BRISK, the jerk is not limited; instead, each axis traverses with the maximum possible acceleration.
4xxx:
	When smoothing with G644, the maximum deviations of each axis specified in MD COMPRESS_POS_TOL are adhered to. In contrast to the value 0xxx, the specified tolerance is fully utilized where possible. The axis then does not reach its maximum possible dynamic response.
5xxx:
	When smoothing with G644, the smoothing distance is specified (ADIS or ADISPOS). In contrast to the value 1xxx, the specified smoothing distance is also fully utilized where possible. The axes involved then might not reach their maximum dynamic response.

Possible values for the ten-thousands digit (various special setting options for G641/G642/G645):

0xxxx:
	The velocity profiles of the axes in the smoothing range are defined without jerk limitation when BRISK is active, and with jerk limitation when SOFT is active.
1xxxx:
	The velocity profiles of the axes in the smoothing range are always defined with jerk limitation no matter whether BRISK or SOFT is active.

2xxxx: When smoothing tangential block transitions with G645, "counter motion" may occur when moving along the contour. This can be avoided if circles are involved. If this function is activated, the circles involved are reduced by the set tolerance. As a consequence, the smoothed contour runs on the inner side of the tolerance band and "counter motion" is avoided.

4xxxx:    When smoothing with G641/G642 and G645, the smoothing movements of the orientation axes are made with vector interpolation if possible, this is conditional upon vector interpolation being active in both the blocks involved and the active orientation transformation permitting this (e.g. by pole handling).
              By default, the orientation axes are always smoothed by means of rotary axis interpolation.

The values of the units, tens, hundreds and ten-thousands digits are added.
The values of the thousands digit are interpreted individually.

<brief>Behavior of smoothing of orientations with OST/OSD</brief>
<description>Settings for the behavior of smoothing of orientation motions with OST/OSD.
It can be set how block transitions are smoothed if addition rotary axes are participating in a path motion which do not act as orientation axes in a transformation. If the value of this MD is zero, for OST/OSD at a block transition, only rotary axes that act as orientation axes in a transformation are smoothed. For values &lt;&gt; 0, any existing additional rotary axes are also smoothed, depending on the situation.

Meaning of the unit position:

x0: Additional rotary axes are not smoothed.
x1: Additional rotary axes are only smoothed if rotary axis interpolation is active for orientation.
x2: Additional rotary axes are smoothed even if vector interpolation is active. In this case, in both blocks it is switched to rotary axis interpolation. Depending on machine kinematics and situation, the switchover can cause undesired rotary axis movements (orientation changes).

Meaning of the decade:

0x: If no orientation transformation is active, rotary axis motions with OST/OSD are not smoothed.
1x: Even without active transformation, rotary axis motions are smoothed. This permits the active smoothing of rotary axes with OST/OSD even without active orientation transformation.

<description>This MD is used to set the compressor operating mode.
The units digits, the tens digits and the hundreds digits have different meanings.
The following options are available:

Units digits:
0:	With the compressor, the tolerances specified with MD33100 $MA_COMPRESS_POS_TOL are met for all axes (geometry and orientation axes).
1:	With the compressor, the contour tolerances specified with SD42475 $SC_COMPRESS_CONTUR_TOL are active for the geometry axes.
	For the orientation axes, the axis-specific tolerances MD33100 $MA_COMPRESS_POS_TOL are active.
2:	With the compressor, the axis-specific tolerances MD33100 $MA_COMPRESS_POS_TOL become active for the geometry axes. The orientation movement is compressed in compliance with the maximum angular deviations specified with SD42476 $SC_COMPRESS_ORI_TOL or SD42477 $SC_COMPRESS_ORI_ROT_TOL.
3:	With the compressor, the contour tolerance SD42475 $SC_COMPRESS_CONTUR_TOL becomes active for the geometry axes and the maximum angular deviation SD42476 $SC_COMPRESS_ORI_TOL or SD42477 $SC_COMPRESS_ORI_ROT_TOL becomes active for the orientation axes.

Tens digits:
The tens digits of this MD can be used to set a compressor response that is compatible with previous software releases (&lt; SW 6.3).

0x:	All blocks with orientations and value assignments are compressed.
	This is the default setting.
	Notice: This response is incompatible with previous software releases!

1x:	Blocks with value assignments are not compressed (e.g. X=100 ..., etc.)

2x:	Blocks with a programmed tool orientation are not compressed.
	(e.g. A3= B3= C3=).

3x:	All blocks with value assignments and/or programmed tool orientation are not compressed. With this setting, the response is fully compatible with previous software releases (&lt; 6.3).

Hundreds digits:
The hundreds digit can be used to set which blocks in addition to G01 blocks are to be compressed or not:
0xx: Circular blocks and G00 blocks are not compressed. Is compatible with previous releases.
1xx: Circular blocks are linearized and compressed by COMPCAD.
2xx: G00 blocks are compressed; a different tolerance may be applied here (see MD 20560 $MC_G0_TOLERANCE_FACTOR).
3xx: Combination of the two previous options: Both circular blocks and G00 blocks are compressed.

 The thousands digits optimize the compressor for different machine types:
0xxx: Optimization for a good surface quality in tool and mold building.
1xxx: Optimization for soft and fast traversing in special applications.

<description>A block transition is normally only smoothed with G64x when the path velocity at block transition is reduced by the overload factor set in MD32310 $MA_MAX_ACCEL_OVL_FACTOR. When SOFT is active, the maximum jerk occurring at block transitions is also limited by MD32432 $MA_PATH_TRANS_JERK_LIM. This means that the effect of smoothing with G64x depends on the values set for the overload factor and possibly for the maximum jerk.

Centripetal acceleration is not required for linear blocks; the full axis acceleration is therefore available for the path acceleration. On slightly curved contours or with a sufficiently low maximum path feedrate $MC_CURV_EFFECT_ON_PATH_ACCEL has only a partial or no effect.

<brief>Circle end point monitoring constant</brief>
<description>This machine data is used to specify the permissible absolute circle error [mm].
When a circle is programmed, both conditions (that the distances from the programmed center point to the start and end points (circle radius) must be the same and that the center point of the circle must be located on the perpendicular bisector of the straight line connecting the start and end points (perpendicular bisector of the circular plane)) apply.
The fact that the circular parameters can be freely programmed means that these conditions are not usually met exactly in the case of circle programming with I, J, and K (the circle is "overdefined").
The maximum permissible difference between the two radii that is accepted without an alarm, as well as the distance between the programmied center point of the circle and the perpendicular bisector described above, is defined by the larger value in the following data:
- MD21000 $MC_CIRCLE_ERROR_CONST
- Start radius multiplied by MD21010 $MC_CIRCLE_ERROR_FACTOR

<name>ORIPATH_MODE</name>
<brief>Setting for ORIPATH path-relative orientation</brief>
<description>This MD is used to set the response for ORIPATH, i.e. path-relative interpolation of tool orientation.
The various digits of this machine data are used to activate different functions for ORIPATH.
The tens digit of this MD enables the specification of the way in which the programmed LEAD and TILT angles are to be interpreted.
This setting option is also significant without active ORIPATH if offsets have been programmed for the LEAD and TILT angles
(with $P_OFF_LEAD and $P_OFF_TILT or $AC_OFF_LEAD and $AC_OFF_TILT).

Meaning of the units digit: Activation of "true" path-relative orientation interpolation

xxx0:
	The tool orientation has the relation to the path tangent and the normal vector programmed with LEAD and TILT only at the end of the block; within the block, the orientation does not follow the path tangent. This corresponds to the response in SW release 6.xx.

xxx1:
	The tool orientation relation to the path tangent and the surface normal vector programmed with LEAD/TILT is retained throughout the block. Meaning of the tens digit: Interpretation of the TILT angle.


Meaning of the tens digit: Interpretation of the LEAD and TILT angles. This applies both to the angles programmed with LEAD and TILT with path-relative orientation interpolation (ORIPATH),
as well as to offsets of the LEAD and TILT angles, which can also be programmed without ORIPATH by means of $P_OFF_LEAD and $P_OFF_TILT or $AC_OFF_LEAD and $AC_OFF_TILT.
With path-relative orientation, the coordinate system is formed by the two vectors path tangent and normal vector. If an offset is applied to a programmed orientation,
the current orientation itself takes over the role of the normal vector. A plane is then formed by the current orientation and the path tangent, in which the rotation is made perpendicularly with the LEAD angle or
the TILT angle.

xx0x:
     The angles programmed with LEAD and TILT are evaluated in the following rotation sequence:
	1. LEAD = Rotation around direction vertical to tangent and normal vector/orientation vector (forward angle)
	2. TILT = Rotation of orientation around normal vector
	This is the interpretation of the LEAD/TILT angles in SW releases &lt; 7.2

xx1x:
     The angles programmed with LEAD and TILT are evaluated in the following rotation sequence:
              1. LEAD = Rotation around direction vertical to tangent and normal vector/orientation vector (forward angle)
	2. TILT = Rotation of orientation around vector in direction of tangent (tilt angle)

xx2x:
     The angles programmed with LEAD and TILT are evaluated in the following rotation sequence:
              1. LEAD = Rotation around direction vertical to tangent and normal vector/orientation vector (forward angle)
	2. TILT = Rotation of orientation around vector in direction of rotated (new) tangent (tilt angle)

xx3x:
     The angles programmed with LEAD and TILT are evaluated in the following rotation sequence:
	1. TILT = Rotation of orientation around vector in direction of tangent (tilt angle)
              2. LEAD = Rotation around direction vertical to tangent and normal vector/orientation vector (forward angle)

xx4x:
     The angles programmed with LEAD and TILT are evaluated in the following rotation sequence:
	1. TILT = Rotation of orientation around vector in direction of tangent (tilt angle)
              2. LEAD = Rotation around direction vertical to tangent and rotated (new) normal vector/orientation vector (forward angle)


Meaning of hundreds digit: Activation of a retract movement in the case of reorientation.

0xx:
	In the case of reorientation with ORIPATH, a retract movement is not executed.

1xx:
	In the case of reorientation with active ORIPATH, a retract movement in the direction of the programmed vector is executed. The programmed vector for the direction of the retract movement refers to the coordinate system defined by the current tool direction (z coordinate) and the change in orientation (x coordinate).

2xx:
	In the case of reorientation with active ORIPATH, a retract movement in the direction of the programmed vector is executed. The programmed vector for the direction of the retract movement refers to the coordinate system defined by the current surface normal vector (z coordinate) and the change in orientation (x coordinate).

A retract movement is possible only with a "true" path-relative orientation interpolation, i.e. if the units digit of this MD has a value of one.


Meaning of the thousands digit: Response of path-relative orientation on activation / deactivation of tool offset.

0xxx:
	The path-relative orientation is also retained in activation / deactivation blocks associated with tool offset.

1xxx:
	The path-relative orientation is not retained in activation / deactivation blocks associated with tool offset. In these blocks, the tool orientation usually remains constant. However, tool orientation can be programmed in these blocks and then traversed there, although any orientation has to be programmed with vectors (the programming of rotary axis positions is not permitted).

<name>POLE_ORI_MODE</name>
<brief>Response with vector interpolation in pole position</brief>
<description>This MD defines how the change in orientation in the case of vector interpolation is treated if the orientation runs through the pole taper, which is defined by MD24540,24640,25240,35340 $MC_TRAFO5_POLE_LIMIT_1,2,3,4.
Vector interpolation is present, if tool orientation is interpolated independent of the kinematics, e.g. by means of large circle interpolation (orientation is swiveled in a plane), taper interpolation or through interpolation of a 2nd reference point on the tool (ORICURVE), and not directly the orientation axes.

In the pole, the pole axis can have any position. For large circle interpolation, however, this axis requires a certain orientation.

If the start orientation is equal or close to the pole orientation and the end orientation of the block lies outside the tolerance circle defined by machine data TRAFO5_POLE_LIMIT_n, the pole axis can be moved to a position suitable to ensure that the subsequent vector interpolation can be carried out. This is set via the units and tens digits of this machine data.

The units digits can have the following values (active if start orientation is equal to pole orientation):

0:	The interpolation is carried out as an axis interpolation. The specified orientation path (large circle) is followed only if the pole axis (coincidentally) has the right position and the basic orientation is perpendicular to the 2nd rotary axis.

1:	A block, that positions the pole axis such that large circle interpolation can be carried out in the subsequent block, is inserted before the block where the described situation occurs.

2:	If the block preceding the block, in which the described situation occurs, contains a geometry axis movement but no orientation movement, the required positioning movement of the pole axis is additionally carried out in this previous block.
	If one of the two conditions is not fulfilled (block does not contain a geometry axis movement or block contains an orientation movement), the pole axis movement is carried out in a separate block (same behavior as under 1.)

The tens digits can have the following values (active if the start orientation differs from the pole orientation, but lies within the tolerance circle defined by TRAFO5_POLE_LIMIT_n):
00:	The interpolation is carried out as an axis interpolation. The specified orientation path (large circle) is followed only if the pole axis (coincidentally) has the right position and the basic orientation is perpendicular to the 2nd rotary axis.

10:	A block that positions the two rotary axes to the point where the programmed large circle interpolation intersects with the tolerance circle defined by TRAFO5_POLE_LIMIT_n is inserted before the block where the described situation occurs. In the original block, large circle interpolation is applied as of this point.

20:	If the block preceding the block in which the described situation occurs contains a geometry axis movement but no orientation movement, the necessary positioning movements of the two rotary axes are additionally carried out in this previous block. The residual movement in the original block is the same as that of value 10 of this machine data.
	If one of the two conditions is not fulfilled (block does not contain a geometry axis movement or block contains an orientation movement), the pole axis movement is carried out in a separate block (same behavior as under 10.)

The hundreds digit of this MD is used to set the behavior in case the orientation runs through the pole taper or ends within the pole taper.
The hundreds digit can have the following values:

000:	A block with the orientation running within the pole taper is subdivided only if the start orientation is equal to the pole orientation (with POLE_ORI_MODE = 1) or is close to the pole orientation (with POLE_ORI_MODE = 10). If the pole orientation occurs at an arbitrary point in the block, the whole change in orientation is traversed by means of rotary axis interpolation. In general, this leads to a more or less significant deviation from the programmed orientation path.

100:	If the programmed orientation path runs through the pole taper, the block is subdivided in up to 3 parts, so that there is a deviation from the orientation path only within the pole taper. Outside the pole taper, the orientation is interpolated exactly on the programmed orientation path.

The pole handling behavior with active ORIANGLE (interpolation of orientation in virtual axis angles) is set with the thousands digit of the MD.

0xxx:       With this setting, the normal pole behavior is active even if ORIANGLE is active. If the transformation causes a switchover to axis interpolation due to a pole, orientation is interpolated by means of the real rotary axes. This can result in considerable deviations from the programmed orientation path. Any different settings of the MD $MC_POLE_ORI_MODE are also effective. This means, for example, that by means of the setting MD21108 $MC_POLE_ORI_MODE = 100, this behavior can be changed such that deviations from the programmed orientation path only occur within the pole taper.

1xxx:       If ORIANGLE is active, there is never a switchover to the interpolation of the orientation by means of real rotary axes. The orientation is always interpolated with virtual axis angles (e.g. Euler angle or RPY angle). Different settings of the MD21108 $MC_POLE_ORI_MODE do not become effective. For example, with MD21108 $MC_POLE_ORI_MODE = 1100 the division of the orientation movement, which was activated by the value 100, does not become effective. Therefore, if MD21108 $MC_POLE_ORI_MODE = 1xxx, the units, tens and hundreds digits are ignored.

Using the ten thousands digit, it is possible to set whether for the generic 5/6 axis transformation, alarm 14112 should be output, if the intermediate orientations do not lie in the orientation range of the kinematics but final orientation of the block is possible:

0xxxx:	The intermediate orientations are checked, as to whether these can be reached. If an orientation characteristic is programmed which goes through the range that cannot be reached, alarm 14112 (program orientation path not possible) is output.

1xxxx:	The intermediate orientations are checked as to whether these can be reached. However, no alarm is output if the orientation runs through the range that cannot be reached, instead, the orientation change is performed using the rotary axis interpolation. This can result in significant deviations in orientation from the programmed orientation characteristic.


The values of the units, tens, hundreds and thousands digits are added. If the thousands digit = 1, the remaining decimals of the MD are not evaluated (with the exception of the ten thousands digit).

<name>ROT_AX_SWL_CHECK_MODE</name>
<brief>Check of software limits for orientation axes</brief>
<description>This machine data is evaluated only with the generic 5-axis transformation.
If the block preparation shows that the path programmed in the direction programming would lead to a violation of the software limits of the orientation axes, this machine data determines how the motions of the rotary axes have to be modified.
The units digit of the MD is used to determine how alternative end positions of the rotary axes are created if the software limits would be violated. The tens digit is used to determine how the axes approach these end positions. The hundreds digit is used to activate an automatic limitation of the axis that swivels through the pole (non-pole axis).

Meaning of the units digit:
0:	The path is not modified. Alarm 10720 (SW_LIMITSWITCH) is output if it is not possible to travel along the shortest path.
1:	If the initially determined orientation path would violate the limits of the orientation axes, an attempt is made to modify the end points so that a motion becomes possible.
	The first attempt uses the second solution. (There are usually two solutions to the conversion: orientation ==&gt; angle of axis). If this solution would also violate the axis limits, an attempt is made to find a permissible solution by modifying both rotary axes by multiples of 360 degrees in both solutions.
	The modifications of end positions described will only be performed if axis interpolation of rotary axes is active.
2:	Monitoring and possibly modifications of the rotary-axis positions are the same as those when the machine data has the value 1.
	However, modifications are also permissible if vector interpolation (large-circle interpolation, taper circumference interpolation, etc.) is active. If, in such a case, the rotary-axes positions would have to be modified, there is a switch to axis interpolation. The originally programmed orientation path will then usually not be followed.

Meaning of the tens digit:
0x:	The orientation axes travel simultaneously to their possible end positions. There may be larger or smaller deviations from the original orientation path.

1x:	If possible, the orientation is first rotated in the pole direction. In the pole position, the pole axis is then positioned so that the final orientation can be approached by rotating the orientation from the pole position into the programmed direction. The originally programmed orientation path is then followed.

Meaning of the hundreds digit:
0xx:	 The range of the non-pole axis is determined by its software limits or working area limitations.

1xx:	The range of the non-pole axis is limited either in the positive or negative travel range. The possible range is limited by the larger of the absolute positive and negative values.
	Examples:
	 1. MD36100 $MA_POS_LIMIT_MINUS[AX5] = -5.0 and MD36110 $MA_POS_LIMIT_PLUS[AX5] = 135.0, the possible range of axis AX5 is 0 ... 135.0
	 2. MD36100 $MA_POS_LIMIT_MINUS[AX5] = -100.0 and MD36110 $MA_POS_LIMIT_PLUS[AX5] = 10.0, the possible range of axis AX5 is -100.0 ... 0.0
	3. MD36100 $MA_POS_LIMIT_MINUS[AX5] = 5.0 und MD36110 $MA_POS_LIMIT_PLUS[AX5] = 120.0, the possible range is 5.0 ... 120.0, there is no automatic limitation of the travel range.
Meaning of the thousands digit: Reserved.

0: $AA_TOFF handwheel override possible only after activation of the $AA_TOFF function by TOFFON.
1: $AA_TOFF handwheel override possible without activation of the $AA_TOFF function by TOFFON.

Bit 10: Axis assignment of the TOFF components on plane change.
0: The axis components are exchanged cyclically on plane change from G17 to G18 or G19. This means that all three axes of the rotated coordinate system point in the positive axis directions of the initial coordinate system.
1: The coordinate system is rotated -90 degrees around the X axis on plane change from G17 to G18, and 90 degrees around the Y axis on plane change from G17 to G18.
   In both cases, the rotated Z axis points in the same direction as when bit 10 is not set.
   The other two axes are exchanged in comparison to the setting with bit 10 not set, and one of the two axes points in the negative direction.
   This setting should only be used if compatibility with older software versions is required (SW 4.5 and older). This setting is not recommended for new developments.

<brief>Synchron. spindle pair def, mach. axis no: follow. spindle [0], lead.sp [1]</brief>
<description>One pair of synchronous spindles per NC channel can be defined in a fixed configuration with this machine data.

The machine axis numbers (channel-specific MD20070 $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED) applicable in the NC channel must be entered for the following spindle [n=0] and the leading spindle [n=1].

The coupling is not regarded as configured if values of "0" are entered, thus leaving 2 couplings to be configured freely via the NC part program.

<brief>Type of coupling in synchronous spindle operation</brief>
<description>This machine data determines the type of coupling for the fixed coupling configuration defined with machine data COUPLE_AXIS_1[n].

1:	Setpoint coupling activated.
	With a setpoint coupling, the reference variable for the following spindle is calculated from the position setpoint of the leading spindle, thus allowing the setpoints for the FS and LS to be input simultaneously. This has a particularly positive effect on the spindle synchronism during acceleration and deceleration processes.

	A setpoint coupling thus achieves better command behavior than an actual-value coupling.

	When a setpoint coupling is used, the following conditions must be fulfilled before synchronous mode is activated:
- The LS must be assigned to the same NC channel as the FS
- The FS and LS must be in position control mode (SPCON)
- The FS and LS must have the same dynamic control response

0:	Actual-value coupling activated.
	With an actual-value coupling, the command variable for the following spindle is calculated from the actual position value of the leading spindle. With this type of coupling, the following drive must be significantly more dynamic than the leading drive, but never vice versa.

	The actual-value coupling can be used, for example, in the following cases:
- The LS must be assigned to a different NC channel than the FS.
- For leading spindles which are not suitable for position control.
- In cases where the dynamic control response of the leading spindle is considerably slower than that of the following spindle. As soon as the actual-value coupling is active, the NC/PLC interface signal &lt;Istwertkopplung/&gt; (Actual-value coupling) for the FS is set to "1-signal".

2:	Speed coupling activated.
	Internally, the speed coupling is a setpoint coupling. Lower dynamic requirements are placed on the FS and LS. A defined relation between the positions of the FS and LS cannot be established.

	A speed coupling is used in the following cases:
- LS and/or FS are not in position control.
- There are no measuring systems present.

The coupling type can be altered in the NC part program when the coupling is deactivated by means of language instruction COUPDEF provided this option has not been inhibited by the channel-specific MD21340 $MC_COUPLE_IS_WRITE_PROT_1. However, the parameterized value of channel-specific MD21310 $MC_COUPLING_MODE_1 remains unchanged.

<brief>Block change behavior in synchronous spindle operation</brief>
<description>This machine data determines the condition under which a block change has to be executed when synchronous mode is activated for the fixed coupling configuration defined in the channel-specific machine data COUPLE_AXIS_ [n].

The following options are available:

0:	Block change is enabled immediately
1:	Block change in response to "Fine synchronization"
2:	Block change in response to "Coarse synchronization"
3:	Block change in response to IPOSTOP (i.e. after setpoint-based synchronization)

The block change response can be altered in the NC part program with language instruction COUPDEF provided this option is not inhibited by the channel-specific MD21340 $MC_COUPLE_IS_WRITE_PROT_1. However, the parameterized value of the channel-specific MD21320 $MC_COUPLE_BLOCK_CHANGE_CTRL_1 remains unchanged.

The selected block change response remains valid even when the velocity ratio is changed or a defined angular offset is programmed while the coupling is active.

<description>The T function is used to select a tool in the program. The setting in this machine data determines whether the new tool is loaded immediately on execution of the T function:

MD22550 $MC_TOOL_CHANGE_MODE = 0
The new tool is loaded directly with the programming of T or D. This setting is mainly used on  turning machines. If a D is not programmed in the block by T, then the tool offset defined in MD20270 $MC_CUTTING_EDGE_DEFAULT is active.
In this case, the function "Manual tools" is not enabled.

The new tool is prepared for loading on execution of the T function. This setting is used mainly on milling machines with a tool magazine in order to bring the new tool into the tool change position without interrupting the machining process. The M function entered in MD22560 $MC_ TOOL_CHANGE_M_CODE is used to remove the old tool from the spindle and load the new  tool onto the spindle.

<brief>Response to tool change errors</brief>
<description>Behavior if faults/problems occur during programmed tool change.

Bit 0=0: Standard behavior: Stop at the faulty NC block
Bit 0=1: If a fault is detected in the block with the tool change preparation, the alarm relevant to the preparation command T is delayed until the corresponding tool change command (M06) has been interpreted in the program sequence. Until then, the alarm triggered by the preparation command is not output. The operator can take corrective actions in this block. When the program continues, the faulty NC block is re-interpreted, and the preparation command is automatically executed again internally.
The value = 1 is relevant only if the setting MD22550 $MC_TOOL_CHANGE_MODE = 1 is used.

Bit 1 Only relevant with active tool management.
Bit 1=0: Standard behavior: Only tools with data assigned to a magazine are detected during tool change preparation.
Bit 1=1: Manual tools can be loaded.
A tool will also be loaded if its data is known in the NCK but has not been assigned to a magazine. In this case, the tool data is automatically assigned to the programmed toolholder.
The user is prompted to insert tools into or remove tools from the toolholder.

Bit 2 qualifies the offset programming
Bit 2=0: active D no. &gt; 0 and active T no.=0 gives offset 0
Active D no. &gt; 0 and active D no.=0 gives total offset 0
Bit 2=1: active D no. &gt; 0 and active T no.=0 lead to an alarm message
Active D no. &gt; 0 and active D no.=0 lead to an alarm message

Bits 3 and 4 are only relevant with active tool management.
Function:
Control of the behavior of the init. block generation on program start if an unserviceable tool is on the spindle and this tool is to be activated.
See also: MD20112 $MC_START_MODE_MASK, MD20110 $MC_RESET_MODE_MASK
On RESET, this does not affect the behavior "Keep disabled tool on the spindle active".

Bit 3=0: Standard: If the tool on the spindle is unserviceable, generate a tool change command requesting a replacement tool. An alarm will be generated if there is no such replacement tool.
Bit 3=1: The status of the unserviceable spindle tool is ignored. (Exception: disabled tools.) The tool becomes active. The subsequent part program should be formulated so that no parts are machined with the unserviceable tool.

Bit 4=0: Standard: The system tries to activate the spindle tool or its replacement tool
Bit 4=1: If the tool on the spindle is unserviceable, T0 is programmed in the start init block.
The combination of bits 3 and 4 produces the following statements:
0 / 0: Behavior as before, automatic change on NC start if an unserviceable tool is in the spindle
1 / 0: Is not always automatically changed
0 / 1: A T0 is automatically generated if an unserviceable tool is in the spindle at NC start
1 / 1: No statement

Bit 5: Reserved

Bit 6=0: Standard: If T0 or D0, only T0 or D0 is exactly programmed.
This means that MD20270 $MC_CUTTING_EDGE_DEFAULT and MD20272 $MC_SUMCORR_DEFAULT define, with the programming of T0 the value of D, DL.
For example, MD20270 $MC_CUTTING_EDGE_DEFAULT=1
MD20272 $MC_SUMCORR_DEFAULT=2
MD22550 $MC_TOOL_CHANGE_MODE=0 (tool change with T programming)
N10 T0; T no. 0 has active number D1 and DL=2 which results in offset zero. If bit 2 is also set:
Programming of
 a) T0; for tool deselection
 b) D0; for offset deselection
generates an alarm, if at least one of the machine data
MD20270 $MC_CUTTING_EDGE_DEFAULT
MD20272 $MC_SUMCORR_DEFAULT
 is not equal to zero (T0 D0 DL=0 is the correct programming).
or MD20272 $MC_SUMCORR_DEFAULT is not equal to zero (D0 DL=0 is the correct programming).
Bit 6=1: controls the NCK response when programming (x, y, z all greater than zero), if at least one of
MD20270 $MC_CUTTING_EDGE_DEFAULT
MD20272 $MC_SUMCORR_DEFAULT
is not equal to zero.
a) Tx Dy -&gt; T0
T0 is automatically programmed in NCK D0 or D0 DL=0; i.e. values not equal to zero of MD20270 $MC_CUTTING_EDGE_DEFAULT, MD20272 $MC_SUMCORR_DEFAULT are treated as value equal to zero.
b) Tx Dy -&gt; T0 Dy, or T0 DL =z, or T0 Dy DL=z, or T0 D0 DL=z explicitly programmed values of D, DL are not influenced.
c) Dy DL=z -&gt; D0
With D0, DL=0 is automatically programmed in the NCK; i.e. values in MD20272 $MC_SUMCORR_DEFAULT unequal to zero are treated as values equal to zero.
d) Dy DL=z -&gt; D0 DL=z
Explicitly programmed values of DL are not influenced.
If bit 2 is also set:
Only T0 / D0 have to be programmed for tool/offset deselection, and this does not generate an alarm.
The statements relating to MD20272 $MC_SUMCORR_DEFAULT or DL are only valid if the total offset function is active
(see MD18080 $MN_MM_TOOL_MANAGEMENT_MASK, bit 8).

Bit 7=0: When Tx is programmed, a check is made to see whether a tool with T number x is known in the TO unit of the channel. If not, the program is stopped in this block with alarm 17190.
Bit 7=1: only if the tool basic functionality is active
(MD20310 $MC_TOOL_MANAGEMENT_MASK, bit 0,1=0)
and (MD18102 $MN_MM_TYPE_OF_CUTTING_EDGE=0):
When Tx is programmed, an unknown Tx is initially ignored, and the alarm relating to the preparation command (Tx) is also ignored until the D selection is interpreted in the program sequence. Only then is alarm 17191, which has been triggered by the preparation command, output. This means that the operator can take corrective actions with the D selection in this block. When the program is continued, the incorrect NC block is re-interpreted, and the preparation command is automatically executed again internally.
(This is of interest for Cutting-Edge-Default=0 or =-2 and D0 programming, otherwise the D of Cutting-Edge-Default is deselected on tool change.).)
This variant is justified for programming "Tool number=Location" (turret as toolholder) without tool management. The turret can now be positioned on a location for which a tool has not (yet) been defined.
This bit has no meaning if bit 0=1 is set.

Bit 8=0: A tool that is located at a blocked magazine location is not taken into account when selecting a tool. (default setting)
Bit 8=1: Even a tool that is located at a blocked magazine location is taken into account when selecting a tool (this corresponds to the previous behavior.)

Bit 9=0: The tool status "to unload" ($TC_TP8[T_No] bit10=1) has no meaning. (default setting)
Bit 9=1: A tool with the status "to unload" ($TC_TP8[T_No] bit10=1) is not selected in T programming.
Bit 9=1: If a multitool or one of the tools on the multitool has the status "to unload" ($TC_MTP8[MT_No] or $TC_TP8[T_No] Bit10=1)
the tools on the multitool are not selected in T programming.

Activating diagnostics

An internal ring buffer records important events.
After a trigger event, the 'Cancel alarm' key is set as default,
the ring buffer is briefly frozen, read, and converted into an ASCII file
in the part program directory. The file name for the 1st channel
is ncsctr01.mpf and for the 7th channel it is ncsctr07.mpf.
The data in the ring buffer is referred to as dynamic data in the following.
In addition to the trigger event, other up-to-date data is read from the
NCK and transferred to the ASCII file. These recordings do
NOT have a history and are referred to as static data in the following.

Bit no.   Significance when bit is set
------------------------------------------------------------------
0 (LSB) Recording of dynamic data (see TRACE_VARIABLE_NAME)
1      Recording of block control static data
2      Recording of alarm data static data

MD = 1 (TRUE) :
	Sign is not reversed and the traversing direction is defined according to MD32100 $MA_AX_MOTION_DIR.

This machine data does not mean that the rotational direction of the rotary axis concerned is to be reversed, but specifies whether its motion is in the mathematically positive or negative direction when the axis is moving in the positive direction.
The result of a change to this machine data is not therefore a change in the rotational direction, but a change in the compensatory motion of the linear axes.

However, if a directional vector and thus, implicitly, a compensatory motion is specified, the result is a change in the rotational direction of the rotary axis concerned.

For the 5-axis transformation, the two orientation axes of the tool form a coordinate system of length and width circles on a  spherical surface. If orientation programming (that is the orientation vector lies in a plane) leads the path so close past the pole that the angle defined by the MD is undershot then there is a deviation from the defined interpolation such that the interpolation runs through the pole.

<description>This MD designates an end angle tolerance for the fifth axis of the first 5-axis transformation with the following properties:

With the interpolation through the pole point, only the fifth axis moves, the fourth axis retains its starting position. If a motion is programmed that does not run exactly through the pole point but will run near the pole within the area given by MD: TRAFO5_NON_POLE_LIMIT_n, there is a deviation from the defined path as the interpolation runs exactly through the pole point. This results in a deviation in the position of the end point of the fourth axis (the polar axis) from the programmed value.

This MD defines the angle by which the polar axis may deviate from the programmed value with 5-axis transformation when switching from the programmed interpolation to the interpolation through the pole point.
Alarm 14112 is output if there is a greater deviation and the interpolation is not executed.

<brief>End angle tolerance for tool orientation</brief>
<description>End angle tolerance for interpolation through the pole for the 1st 5/6-axis transformation.
This MD is evaluated only by the generic 5/6-axis
transformation.

If the programmed end orientation lies within the body cone and within the tolerance cone specified by this MD, the pole axis does not move
and retains it starting positions. The other rotary axis, however,
moves to the programmed angle.
This results in the end orientation deviating
from the programmed orientation.

Another function of this MD is the handling of the programmmed end orientation with
non-orthogonal kinematics. As a rule, not all tool orientations can be set with
these machine kinematics.
Alarm 14112 is output if an orientation is programmed that lies outside the
settable range of the orientation cone (the programmed orientation path is not possible).
However, if the programmed orientation still lies within the range defined by MD24542 $MC_TRAFO5_POLE_TOL,
an alarm is not output, and the programmed orientation is accepted.
However, the programmed orientation is corrected so that the orientation remains
stationary at the edge of the settable range.

<description>The positions (angles) of the rotary axes are defined by the offset for the orientation axes of the 5/6-axis transformation, whereby the tool orientation is in the basic position. This offset has 2 components. The first one is the value of MD24510 $MC_TRAFO5_ROT_AX_OFFSET_1 for the 1st orientation transformation. For the other orientation transformations, these are the values of MD24610/25210/25310 $MC_TRAFO5_ROT_AX_OFFSET_2/3/4/. The 2nd component is defined when the transformation is activated. Either directly as an optional parameter with the language command TRAORI(), or it can be taken from an active work offset  of the rotary axes that are active when the transformation is activated. This is only taken into the offset of the orientation axes if this MD has the value TRUE, and if the work offsets are retained when the transformation is activated, this means that MD10602: $MN_FRAME_GEOAX_CHANGE_MODE &gt; 0.
Note: In the normal case, the automatic acceptance of active work offsets into the offset is only useful for the polar axis with table kinematics. This means, for example, with AC kinematics for the C-axis. If the offset is changed in another orientation axis, especially in the non-polar axis, this changes the kinematic behavior of the transformation, and may lead to the compensatory motions of the linear axes no longer being correct.

<brief>Sign of rotary axis 1/2/3 for 5-axis transformation 2</brief>
<description>This machine data designates the sign with which the two rotary axes are included in the second 5-axis transformation of a channel.

MD = 0 (FALSE):
	Sign is reversed.
MD = 1 (TRUE) :
	Sign is not reversed and the traversing direction is defined according to MD32100 $MA_AX_MOTION_DIR.

This machine data does not mean that the rotational direction of the rotary axis concerned is to be reversed, but specifies whether its motion is in the mathematically positive or negative direction when the axis is moving in the positive direction.
The result of a change to this data is not therefore a change in the rotational direction, but a change in the compensatory motion of the linear axes.

However, if a directional vector and thus, implicitly, a compensatory motion is specified, the result is a change in the rotational direction of the rotary axis concerned.
On a real machine, therefore, the machine data may be set to FALSE (or zero) only if the rotary axis is turning in an anti-clockwise direction when moving in a positive direction.

MD irrelevant:

<name>TRAFO5_NON_POLE_LIMIT_2</name>
<brief>Definition of pole range for 5-axis transformation 2</brief>
<description>This MD designates a limit angle for the fifth axis of the second 5-axis transformation with the following properties: if the path runs past the pole below this angle, the traverse passes through the pole.

In a 5-axis transformation, the two orientation axes of the tool form a coordinate system of length and width circles on a  spherical surface. If orientation programming (that is the orientation vector lies in a plane) leads the path so closely past the pole that the angle defined by this MD is undershot, then there is a deviation from the defined interpolation such that the interpolation runs through the pole.

Alarm 14112 is output if this modification of the path results in a deviation greater than a tolerance defined by MD24640 $MC_TRAFO5_POLE_LIMIT_2.

<name>TRAFO5_POLE_LIMIT_2</name>
<brief>End angle tolerance for tool orientation</brief>
<description>This MD designates an end angle tolerance for the fifth axis of the second 5-axis transformation with the following properties:

With the interpolation through the pole point, only the fifth axis moves, the fourth axis retains its starting position. If a motion is programmed that does not run exactly through the pole point but is to run near the pole within the area given by MD: TRAFO5_NON_POLE_LIMIT_n then there is a deviation from the defined path as the interpolation runs exactly through the pole point. This results in a deviation in the position of the end point of the fourth axis (the polar axis) from the programmed value.

This MD defines the angle by which the polar axis may deviate from the programmed value with 5-axis transformation when switching from the programmed interpolation to the interpolation through the pole point.
An error message (alarm 14112) is output if there is a greater deviation and the interpolation is not executed.

MD irrelevant:
	If the "5-Axis Transformation" option is not installed.

<name>TRAFO5_POLE_TOL_2</name>
<brief>End angle tolerance for pole interpolation</brief>
<description>End angle tolerance for interpolation through the pole for the 2nd 5/6-axis transformation.
This MD is evaluated only by the generic 5/6-axis
transformation.

If the programmed end orientation lies within the body cone and within the tolerance cone
specified by this MD, the pole axis does not move and retains its starting positions.
However, the other rotary axis moves to the programmed angle.
This results in the end orientation deviating
from the programmed orientation.

Another function of this MD is the handling of the programmmed end orientation with
non-orthogonal kinematics. As a rule, not all tool orientations can be set with
these machine kinematics.
Alarm 14112 is output if an orientation is programmed that lies outside the
settable range of the orientation cone (the programmed orientation path is not possible).
However, if the programmed orientation still lies within the range defined by MD24542 $MC_TRAFO5_POLE_TOL,
an alarm is not output, and the programmed orientation is accepted.
However, the programmed orientation is corrected so that the orientation remains
stationary at the edge of the settable range.

The maximum active value of this MD is the value of MD TRAFO5_POLE_LIMIT_1, which is used to define the body cone.

<brief>Transformation grouping</brief>
<description>Transformation chain of the first concatenated transformation.
In the table, the numbers of the transformations which are to be concatenated are given in the order in which the transformation has to be executed from BCS into MCS.
Example:
A machine can be operated optionally either as a 5-axis machine or as a transmit machine. A linear axis is not arranged at a right-angles to the other linear axes (inclined axis).
5 transformations must be set via the machine data, e.g.
TRAFO_TYPE_1 =   16         (5-axis transformation)
TRAFO_TYPE_2 =  256        (Transmit)
TRAFO_TYPE_3 = 1024       (Inclined axis)
TRAFO_TYPE_4 = 8192       (Concatenated transformation)
TRAFO_TYPE_5 = 8192       (Concatenated transformation)

If the 4th transformation concatenates the 5-axis transformation / inclined axis and the 5th transformation concatenates the transmit / inclined axis, then (1, 3, 0, 0) is entered in the first table TRACON_CHAIN_1, and (2, 3, 0, 0) in the table TRACON_CHAIN_2. The entry 0 means no transformation.

The order in which the transformations are assigned (TRAFO_TYPE_1 to TRAFO_TYPE_20) is arbitrary. The linked transformations do not have to be the last. However, they must always stand behind all the transformations which occur in a transformation chain. In the previous example, this means that, e.g. the third and fourth transformations must not be switched.
However, it would be possible to define a further, sixth transformation, if this does not go into a linked transformation.

Transformations cannot be linked with one another at will.
The following limitations apply in SW version 5:
The first transformation in the chain must be an orientation transformation (3- , 4- , 5-axis transformation, nutator) transmit or peripheral curve transformation. The second transformation must be an inclined axis transformation.
No more than two transformations may be linked.

<brief>Behavior of individual axes with automatic path segmentation</brief>
<description>This machine data defines how single axes that are also nibbling axes within the meaning of MD26010 $MC_PUNCHNIB_AXIS_MASK are to behave.
In this case, there are the following options for the behavior of the single axes during automatic path segmentation and stroke control:

PUNCH_PARTITION_TYPE = 0
No special behavior during automatic path segmentation. If the single axes are programmed together with path axes in one block, then their total traversing path is split up corresponding to the path axes. That is the pure geometric relationship between the single axes and path axes is identical to the undivided motion. If the single axes are programmed without the path axes but with SPN=&lt;value&gt;, then the path is divided accordng to the programmed SPN value.

PUNCH_PARTITION_TYPE = 1
In this case, the path of the single axes, if they are programmed together with path axes, are generally traversed in the first section (that is independently of the currently active type of interpolation).
PUNCH_PARTITION_TYPE = 2
In this case, the single axes behave with linear interpolation in the same way as with PUNCH_PARTITION_TYPE = 1, and with all other types of interpolation in the same way as with PUNCH_PARTITION_TYPE = 0.

<name>NIBBLE_PRE_START_TIME</name>
<brief>Delay time for nibbling/punching with G603</brief>
<description>To minimize any dead times due to the reaction time of the punching unit, it is possible to release the stroke before reaching the in-position window of the axes. The reference time for this is the interpolation end. Since there is normally a delay of some interpolation cycles after reaching the interpolation end (depending on the machine dynamics) until the axes actually come into position, the prestart time is a delay time with respect to reaching the interpolation end.
The function is therefore coupled to G603 (block change at the end of interpolation).
The time can be set via the machine data NIBBLE_PRE_START_TIME).

Example:
	With an interpolation cycle of 5 ms, a stroke shall be released 2 cycles after reaching the interpolation end. In this case, the value 0.010 s must be selected for NIBBLE_PRE_START_TIME. If a value that is not integrally divisible by the set interpolation time is selected, then the stroke is initiated in the interpolation cycle following the set time.

The released data are no longer available to the REORG function (References: /FB /, K1, "Mode Groups, Channels, Program Operation Mode").
A consequence of this status is that a further REORG command is canceled with an error message.
If the status of "non-reorganizability" occurs, warning 15110 is output. The output of the warning can be suppressed by enabling the highest significant bit. The bit is set by adding the value 128 to the input value in REORG_LOG_LIMIT.

<brief>Number of blocks for local user variables in REORG (DRAM)</brief>
<description>Defines the number of additional LUD data blocks available for the function REORG (see Description of Functions, Channels, Mode Groups, Program Operation (K1)).
This value can be 0 if the function REORG is not used. The CNC always opens 12 LUD data blocks, of which 8 are used for NC programs and 4 for the ASUBs.
An LUD data block is needed for each NC program and ASUB in which a local user variable is defined. This value may have to be increased for the function REORG if a large IPO buffer is present and a large number of short NC programs in which LUD variables are defined are active (prepared NC blocks of the programs are located in the IPO buffer).
An LUD data block is needed for each of these programs. The size of the reserved memory is affected by the number of LUDs per NC program and their individual memory requirements. The LUD data blocks are stored in the dynamic memory.

The memory requirement for managing the blocks for local user variables with REORG can be determined as follows:

The size of the LUD blocks depends on the number of active LUDs and their data type. The memory for the LUD blocks is limited by the MD28000 $MC_MM_REORG_LOG_FILE_MEM (memory size for REORG).

Approximately 150 bytes of memory per variable are reserved for the names of the variables and the variable values. The memory required for the variable value is equal to the size of the data type. If the total of the local user variables from the active main program and the related subprograms is larger than the defined limit, the variables which are over the limit are not accepted during execution of the program.

The maximum number of available LUDs is given by one of the limit values of MD28020 $MC_MM_NUM_LUD_NAMES_TOTAL or MD28040 $MC_MM_LUD_VALUES_MEM.
The memory defined here is subdivided into (MD28040 $MC_MM_LUD_VALUES_MEM * 1024) / MD18242 $MN_MM_MAX_SIZE_OF_LUD_VALUE groups, and allocated to part programs which request memory. Each part program that contains at least one definition of an LUD variable or call parameters uses at least one such group.
It should be remembered that several part programs requiring memory can be open simultaneously in the NCK. The number depends on the type of programming, the program length, and the size of the internal NCK block memory upwards of (MD28060 $MC_MM_IPO_BUFFER_SIZE, MD28070 $MC_MM_NUM_BLOCKS_IN_PREP).

Notice
The uppper limit does not indicate that this value is always practical or free of conflicts. If one channel (the first) is active in a system with a maximum of 2 channels, and the other is not, the MD on channel 1 can formally be given the value 2, but the NCK cannot work with it. This setting would mean that channel 1 did not have any blocks for tool offsets, as the channel with ID=2 did not exist.

<brief>Number of elements for writing PLC variables</brief>
<description>The MD defines the number of elements which the user has available for writing PLC variables ($A_DBx=...). This number also applies to block search, but not to synchronized actions.

The memory requirement is ca. 24 bytes per element.
One element is needed for each write action when writing PLC variables in quick succession.
If more writing actions are to be performed than elements are available, block transport must be guaranteed (trigger preprocessing stop, if required)
However, the number of elements can be reduced if the accessing actions are made separately (block transport has already been accomplished). Writing accesses (var=$A_DBx) are unlimited.
