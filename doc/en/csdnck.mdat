<description>The data value is used for measuring the tool radius with the function "Check teeth individually".
The distance (measured at the circumference of the tool) between the points at which measurements are made to find the "highest point on the longest tooth" must be entered.
If the data value is ZERO, then the search for the "highest point on the longest tooth" is not made with a stationary spindle,
instead the value is measured by sampling while the spindle is rotating.

<description>Function mask for measuring cycles

Bit 0: Repeat measurement, workpiece measurement with offset in a tool,
           after tolerance exceeded for dimension difference (TDIF) or confidence range (TSA)
          	0: When one of the tolerances is exceeded, the measurement is not repeated and an appropriate alarm
 	is displayed (alarm 61303 or 61306).
          	1: When one of the tolerances is exceeded, a measurement is repeated up to four times.
	When, for all repeat measurements, one of the tolerances is exceeded, then an appropriate alarm is displayed (alarm 61303 or 61306).

Bit 1: Repeat measurement, workpiece measurement with offset in a tool, program stop at M0,
           After every repeat measurement with tolerance of dimension difference (TDIF) or confidence range (TSA) exceeded and alarm output
           Bit 1 only effective in conjunction with bit 0 = 1.
          	0: If one of the tolerances is exceeded, the measurement is not repeated and an appropriate alarm
 	is displayed (alarm 61303 or 61306).
          	1: If one of the tolerances is exceeded, the measurement is repeated up to four times.
	In the case of a tolerance being repeatedly exceeded, using an appropriate alarm output
	and M0, the measurement is interrupted (alarm 62303 or 62306).
                 With "NC-START", the alarm can be acknowledged, and the next repeat measurement started.

Bit 2: Workpiece measurement with offset in a tool, programmed stop at M0 after tolerance exceeded
            from lower limit workpiece (TLL) or upper limit workpiece (TUL) and alarm output
          	0: If one of the tolerances is exceeded, an appropriate reset alarm is displayed
	    (alarm 61304 or 61305). A tool correction (offset) is not executed.
          	1: If one of the tolerances is exceeded, then using an appropriate alarm output
	and M0, the sequence is canceled (alarm 62304 or 62305).
                 Using "NC-START" these alarms can be acknowledged, and the sequence restarted. The correction (offset) in the tool is executed.

Bit 3: Accept the calibrated radius of the workpiece probe in the tool data
          	0: Do not accept the calibrated radius of the workpiece probe in the tool data.
          	1: Accept the calibrated radius of the workpiece probe in the tool data.

Bit 4: For mixed technologies, turning-milling or milling-turning, the plane between calibrating and
           measuring can be different.
          	0: When measuring workpieces, it is not permissible to have different planes for calibration and measurement.
                  If the planes differ, alarm 61341 is output during the cycle runtime.
          	1: When measuring workpieces, different planes for calibration and measurement are permissible.
	For example: Calibration in G17 and measurement under turning in G18.

Bit 16: Repeat measurement, tool measurement, after tolerances of the dimension difference are exceeded (TDIF)
            or confidence range (TSA) exceeded
          	0: If one of the tolerances is exceeded, the measurement is not repeated, and an appropriate alarm is displayed (alarm 61303 or 61306).
          	1: When one of the tolerances is exceeded, the measurement is repeated up to four times.
	If, for all repeat measurements, one of the tolerances is exceeded, then an appropriate alarm is displayed (alarm 61303 or 61306).

Bit 17: Repeat measurement, tool measurement, programmed stop at M0 after tolerance exceeded, dimension difference (TDIF) or confidence range (TSA) and alarm output
          	0: If one of the tolerances is exceeded, the measurement is not repeated, and an appropriate alarm is displayed (alarm 61303 or 61306).
          	1: If one of the tolerances is exceeded, the measurement is repeated up to four times.
	In the case that the tolerance is exceeded again, using an appropriate alarm output and M0 measurement is canceled (alarm 62303 or 62306).
                 Using "NC-START", the alarm can be acknowledged, and the next repeat measurement started.

Bit 19: Tool measurement, milling technology, reducing the spindle speed at the last probing
           	0: The last probing is realized without reducing the spindle speed.
           	1: At the last probing, the spindle speed is automatically reduced.
