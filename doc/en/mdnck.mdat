<name>AXCONF_MACHAX_NAME_TAB</name>
<brief>Machine axis name</brief>
<description>List of the machine axis identifiers
The name of the machine axis is entered in this MD.
In addition to the fixed, defined machine axis identifiers "AX1", "AX2" ..., user-defined identifiers for the machine axes can also be assigned in this data.
The identifiers defined here can be used parallel to the fixed, defined identifiers for addressing axial data (e.g. MD) and machine axis-related NC functions (reference point approach, axial measurement, travel to fixed stop).

Special cases:
- The input machine axis name must not conflict with the names and assignments of the geometry axes (MD20060 $MC_AXCONF_GEOAX_NAME_TAB, MD20050 $MC_AXCONF_GEOAX_ASSIGN_TAB) and channel axes (MD20080 $MC_AXCONF_CHANAX_NAME_TAB, MD20070 $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED).

The input machine axis name must not conflict with
Names for Euler angle (MD10620 $MN_EULER_ANGLE_NAME_TAB)
Names for path-relevant orientation (MD10624 $MN_ORIPATH_LIFT_VECTOR_TAB)
Names for normal vectors (MD10630 $MN_NORMAL_VECTOR_NAME_TAB)
Names for direction vectors (MD10640 $MN_DIR_VECTOR_NAME_TAB)
Names for rotation vectors (MD10642 $MN_ROT_VECTOR_NAME_TAB)
Names for intermediate vector component (MD10644 $MN_INTER_VECTOR_NAME_TAB)
Names for intermediate circle point coordinates for CIP (MD10660 $MN_INTERMEDIATE_POINT_NAME_TAB)
Names for interpolation parameters (MD10650 $MN_IPO_PARAM_NAME_TAB).


- The input machine axis name must not include any of the following reserved address letters:
D Tool offset           (D function)          E Reserved
F V Feedrate           (F function)          G Path condition
H Auxiliary function (H function)           L Subroutine call
M Miscellaneous function (M function)  N Subblock
P Subroutine number of passes           R Arithmetic parameters
S Spindle speed      (S function)          T Tool (T function)

The name must not include any keywords (e.g. DEF, SPOS etc.) or pre-defined identifiers (e.g. ASPLINE, SOFT).

The use of an axis identifier consisting of a valid address letter (A, B, C, I, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z), followed by an optional numerical extension (1-99) gives slightly better block cycle times than a general identifier.

If no identifier is assigned to a machine axis, the predefined name ("AXn") applies to the nth machine axis).

Corresponds with....
	MD20060 $MC_AXCONF_GEOAX_NAME_TAB (geometry axis name in the channel [GEOAxisno.]
	MD20080 $MC_AXCONF_CHANAX_NAME_TAB (channel axis name in the channel [Channelaxisno.]
The name of the machine axis is entered in this MD.
-	An axis identifier consisting of a valid address letter (A, B, C, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z),
followed by an optional numerical extension (1-99) should preferably be used.
-	The machine axis identifier selected must not be the same as any name of a geometry axis (X, Y, Z) or other channel axis (MD20080 $MC_AXCONF_CHANAX_NAME_TAB if a transformation (e.g.: TRANSMIT) is going to be used.
Note: Transformations are not available in software version P1 with SINUMERIK 802D.
-	A "freely" entered machine axis identifier (axis name) must not be a name, address, keyword or predefied identifier that is already being used in the control or is reserved for any functionality (e.g.: SPOS, DIAMON, ...)
Note: The complete functionality of the SINUMERIK control system with 802D has not been documented. A free axis name can therefore only be used conditionally.

<name>AXCONF_LOGIC_MACHAX_TAB</name>
<brief>Logical NCK machine axis image</brief>
<description>List of machine axes available on an NCU. (Logical NCK machine axis image)

MD10002 $MN_AXCONF_LOGIC_MACHAX_TAB creates another NCK global, logical layer between the channel axis layer and the machine axes in an NCU or NCU grouping. This layer is called the "Logic NckMachineAxImage", abbreviation: LAI ).

Axes can only be assigned between different NCUs via this new intermediate layer!
The entry MD10002 $MN_AXCONF_LOGIC_MACHAX_TAB[ n] = NCj_AXi assigns the machine axis i on the NCU j to the axis index "n" in the LAI.

This makes the following assignments possible:
1.	Local axes (default setting: AX1, AX2 ... AX31)
	The entry MD10002 $MN_AXCONF_LOGIC_MACHAX_TAB[n] = AX3 assigns the local axis AX3 to axis index n. (Default setting AX3 is present for n = 3 . Thus there is compatibility in software version 5 for MD blocks for software versions up to 4).

2.	Link axes (axes that are physically connected to another NCU). The entry MD10002 $MN_AXCONF_LOGIC_MACHAX_TAB[n] = NCj_AXi assigns axis AXi (link axis) on NCU j to axis index n.
Limits:
	n 	Machine axis address (of the local NCU)	1 ... 31
	j	NCU number	1 ... 16
	i	Machine axis address (of the local/remote NCU)	1 ... 31

3.	Axis container in which there are once again either local or link axes. The entry MD10002 $MN_AXCONF_LOGIC_MACHAX_TAB[n] = CTr_SLs assigns container r and slot s to axis index n.
Limits:
	n	Machine axis address (of the local NCU)	1 ... 31
	r	Container number	1 ... 16
	s	Slot number (location) in the container	1 ... 32

The channel layer is formed via the related machine data $MD20070 $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED and no longer points (small P5) directly to the machine axes but to the new LAI layer.

MD20070 $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED [k]=n assigns the LAI axis number "n" to the axis index "k" in the channel layer.

The machine axis and the corresponding NCK can then be determined from the LAI axis number.

If a number of NCUs point to the same machine axis in the cluster as a result of MD10002 $MN_AXCONF_LOGIC_MACHAX_TAB, then the axial machine data MD30554 $MA_AXCONF_ASSIGN_MASTER_NCU must define which NCU generates the master NCU and the setpoint values for the position controller after startup.

<brief>Channel valid in mode group</brief>
<description>This MD assigns the channel to a mode group
Entry value 1 =&gt; Assigned to 1st mode group
Entry value 2 =&gt; Assigned to 2nd mode group
etc.
From software version 4, it is permissible not to assign a mode group number to individual channels.
Channel gaps are allowed, in order to favor uniform configuration in similar types of machines. In this case, the number 0 is assigned to the channel instead of assigning a mode group number equal to or greater than 1. The channel is not activated, however it is handled like an active channel when counting the channels.
E.g.
ASSIGN_CHAN_TO_MODE_GROUP[0] = 1
ASSIGN_CHAN_TO_MODE_GROUP[1] = 1
ASSIGN_CHAN_TO_MODE_GROUP[2] = 0   ; gap
ASSIGN_CHAN_TO_MODE_GROUP[3] = 1

Application example:
Select desired channel via HMI and enter with MD10010 $MN_ASSIGN_CHAN_TO_MODE_GROUP = 1.

<name>SYSCLOCK_CYCLE_TIME</name>
<brief>System clock cycle</brief>
<description>Basic cycle time of the system software

The cycle time settings of cyclical tasks (position controller/IPO) are multiples of this basic cycle. Apart from special applications in which MD10060 $MN_POSCTRL_SYSCLOCK_TIME_RATIO is set greater than 1, the basic cycle corresponds to the position controller cycle.

For PROFIBUS/PROFINET:
In the case of systems with a PROFIBUS DP connection, this MD corresponds to the PROFIBUS DP cycle time. This time is read from the configuration file (SDB-Type-2000) during startup and written to the MD.
This MD can only be changed via the configuration file.

Note:
Reducing this MD can result in an automatic correction of
MD10062 $MN_POSCTRL_CYCLE_DELAY
MD10064 $MN_POSCTRL_CYCLE_DESVAL_DELAY
that cannot be undone by a subsequent increase!

Details:
	The basic cycle is incremented in multiples of units of the measured value sampling cycle. When the system powers up, the entered value is automatically rounded to a multiple of this incrementation.

Note:
	Discrete timer division ratios can give rise to the entered value producing a value that is not an integer after a Power OFF/ON.
For example:
Input                        =0.005s
                               after power OFF/ON   =0.00499840
                     or
Input                        =0.006s

<name>COM_IPO_STRATEGY</name>
<brief>Strategy for activation of communication.</brief>
<description>The call frequency of the communication task can be controlled by MD10072 $MN_COM_IPO_TIME_RATIO.

The communication tasks are activated cyclically. That has some advantages and disadvantages:

Advantages:
- The communication behavior of the NCK is deterministic in relation to the communication task.

Disadvantages:
- The communication task can lead to level overflows.
- In an unloaded NCK system, the speed of communication is determined by MD10072 $MN_COM_IPO_TIME_RATIO. As this machine data is power ON, it cannot adapt to the current NCK operating mode. A typical problem is that uploading a part program can take a very long time on an unloaded NCK. In this case, the bottleneck is the communication task that only progresses in the relation defined by machine data COM_IPO_TIME_RATIO.

This machine data has been introduced to eliminate the above-mentioned disadvantages. It makes the times at which the communication software is activated controllable. The machine data is bit-coded. The bits have the following meanings:

Bit 0:
	The communication software is calculated cyclically
Bit 1:
	The level time overflow monitoring is switched off for the cyclical communication task. This bit is only practical if bit zero is set. The task is implemented in a non-cyclical level that has a higher priority than the preparation/communication level. The communication task makes a delay of the time defined in COM_IPO_TIME_RATIO after each cycle.
Bit 2:
	The communication software is calculated at the start of the task which the domain services accept.
Bit 3:
	The communication software is calculated at the end of the task which the domain services accept.
Bit 4:
	The communication software is calculated at the start of the task which the domain services accept if a PDU upload has arrived. This bit is only useful if bit 2 is set.
Bit 5:
	The communication software is calculated at the end of the task which the domain services accept if a PDU upload has arrived. This bit is only useful if bit 3 is set.

This machine data is only active in systems containing the Softbus communication software. This is in P6 the 840Di with MCI2 software and the solution line systems for P7.

The default value is 0x0F. This means that the COS is calculated prior to and after communiction in order to minimize latencies.

<description>Time information for the CNC about the OB1 cycle time. During this cycle time, it is guaranteed that the auxiliary functions will be acknowledged.
By means of the MD, the status transitions:
"channel operates/ channel in RESET/ channel failure --&gt; channel interrupted" can be delayed for the PLC in case of a RESET. With the output "channel interrupted", the NCK waits at least the time indicated in the MD + 1 IPO cycle.

With the time indication, the path feedrate during path control operation in case of an auxiliary function output during motion is controlled in a way to ensure that the minimum travel time corresponds to the time information. This ensures a uniform velocity behavior which is not disturbed by waiting for the PLC acknowledgement. The internal incrementation is performed in the interpolation cycle.
For the auxiliary function output in the continuous-path mode, the MD is also relevant for the FM357 and 802/802s systems. With SW 5.1 and higher, the other systems are parameterized directly via the PLC.

DRAM is made available for this function in the NCU corresponding to the input in the machine data. The inputs for changing the memory areas have to be taken into account.
The unit of MD10134 $MN_MM_NUM_MMC_UNITS is a "resource unit".
A standard HMI needs 1 resource unit, an HMI100/103 needs 2. OEM variants may need more or less resources.

- If the value is set lower than would be needed for the number of connected HMIs, this is not inevitably problematical. Actions may not function sporadically during multiple, simultaneous, communication-intensive operations (e.g. loading a program): Alarm 5000 is displayed. The operation then has to be repeated.

- If the value is et higher, more dynamic memory is occupied than necessary. The value should be reduced appropriately if the memory is required for other purposes.

<description>Defines how the position and the distance to go are displayed in the Work.
0:	Display as in software version 5 and earlier
1:	At end of block, the actual value display is in principle the same as the programmed end point, irrespective of where the machine actually is (e.g. as a result of the tool radius compensation). The distance to go is the same as the actual distance to be traversed. This means that the displayed actual postion has to be the same as the displayed end position minus the distance to go, irrespective of the actual machine position. If the block end points are changed by chamfers, radii, contour definitions, splines or SAR in comparison to the NC programm, then these changes are reflected in the display as if thay had been programmed. This does not apply to changes resulting from tool radius compensation or smoothing.

<name>TASK_SLEEP_TIME</name>
<brief>Average time transfer per cycle</brief>
<description>Only relevant to simulation systems
In the simulation environment, a machining run designates the execution of the tasks Server, IPO and PREP, which are not interrupted
This machine data now specifies the average time which is transferred to the operating system of the simulation host system per machining run. The unit of the machine data is the microsecond.
As it is not usually possible to transfer times in the microsecond range in the operating system of the simulation host system, the times are calculated over multiple cycles, and then the default time set by the operating system (typically between 10 - 15 milliseconds) is transferred. Multiple cycles are thus executed without delay, and there is a correspondingly longer wait at a later point in time, so that on average, the time set in the MD is transferred. The value 0 deactivates the time transfer.
E.g.: MD10156 $MN_TASK_SLEEP_TIME is set to the value 50 (microseconds), and the minimum given time specified by the operating system is 10 milliseconds (= 10000 microseconds), then there will be a delay of 10 milliseconds every 200 cycles (10000/50).

<name>RELEASE_PREP_CPU_POWER</name>
<brief>Computing time transfer to the preparation task</brief>
<description>The various values mean:
Value 0: In order to specify the utilization, the following information is saved for each channel in each cycle of the preparation task:
          * One block from the preparation is given to the IPO buffer.
          * A function collects multiple blocks in order to process them together (Example: compressor). An exception is block search, in which block collection is ignored.
          * The current percentage IPO buffer fill level is also saved.
        The saving takes place for a fixed number of preparation cycles, from which the utilization is then calculated at the start of each preparation cycle as follows:
          * If contiguous blocks were processed in the last preparation cycles (blocks given away and/or collected) and if the IPO buffer is insufficiently filled, no computing time is given away.
          * If contiguous blocks were processed in the last preparation cycles and if the IPO buffer is sufficiently filled, computing time is given away in principle.
          * Whether the IPO buffer is sufficiently or in sufficiently filled is influenced by damping.
          * If non-contiguous blocks were processed in the last preparation cycles, the computing time is also given away.
        Machine data MD10131 $MN_SUPPRESS_SCREEN_REFRESH directly affects the effect of the computing time transfer:
          * 0: Computing time is only transferred if all channels can give away computing time.
          * 1:  Computing time transfer is determined solely by the first channel.
          * 2: Computing time is always given away every second preparation cycle.
        Computing time is never given away in block search and with active collision avoidance.

Value 1: The following information is collected for each channel in each cycle of the preparation task:
          * One block from the preparation is given to the IPO buffer.
          * At least one block was processed in the previous cycle of the preparation task (block transport).
          * The preparation is occupied with a task that does not perform block processing, but still needs further preparation cycles. These include:
            * Block search
            * Collision avoidance
        The utilization status of the previous cycle is evaluated at the start of the preparation cycle:
          * The following applies to single-channel controls: If at least one of the above events has occurred, the computing time is not given away.
          * With multichannel controls, the computing time is only given away if all the channels can give away computing time.

<brief>Weighting factor for analog NCK inputs</brief>
<description>A weighting factor can be defined with this MD for each analog NCK input [n] to enable adaptation to the various analog-to-digital converters (depending on the I/O module).

The value to be entered in this machine data is the value that is to be read in the part program with the command x = $A_INA[n] if the associated analog input [n] is set to the maximum value or the value +32767 is defined for this input via the PLC interface.

The value read from the analog-to-digital converter or the PLC interface is multiplied by the factor (FASTIO_ANA_INPUT_WEIGHT / 32767) before it can be read in the part program with the system variable $A_INA[n].

Use of the weighting factor for "Analog NCK inputs without hardware": with a weighting factor of 32767, the values defined by the part program and the PLC are numerically identical (1:1 communication between part program and PLC). This is advantageous when the analog NCK inputs/outputs are used purely as PLC inputs/outputs without analog hardware.

Note:
	The comparator threshold values SD41600 $SN_COMPAR_THRESHOLD_1 and SD41601 $SN_COMPAR_THRESHOLD_2 are also normalized to MD10320 $MN_FASTIO_ANA_INPUT_WEIGHT corresponding to their assignment to an analog input.

<brief>Short circuit of digital inputs and outputs</brief>
<description>Defined short circuits between digital output and input signals of the high-speed NCK I/Os are realized by linking the signals read in from the high-speed NCK I/Os or the PLC interface to defined output signals.

The output signals always remain unchanged by the link, the inputs that have to be taken into account internally arise from the read inputs and the link. If a plurality of output bits are specified for one input bit in overwrite mode, the last defined assignment in the list determines the result.

The definition of non-existent or non-activated inputs/outputs is ignored without an alarm.

Bits 0-7:	Number of the input byte to be written ( 1 - 5 )
Bits 8-15:	Bit number within the input byte ( 1 - 8 )

Link:
The type of link is selected by adding a hexadecimal number to the input bit number:
	00   Overwrite input identically to output
	A0   Input is AND-gated to the read input with the status of the stated output
	B0   Input is OR-gated to the read input with the status of the stated output

<name>SW_CAM_TIMER_FASTOUT_MASK</name>
<brief>Mask for output of cam signals via timer interr. to NCU</brief>
<description>A timer-controlled output to the 4 on-board outputs of the NCK I/Os can be selected in this machine data for 4 cam pairs.

In this case, the minus and plus signals of a cam pair are "EXCLUSIVE OR'd" for output as one signal.

Meaning for set bit:
Associated cam (minus and plus cam signals "EXCLUSIVE OR'd") is output via a timer interrupt at one of the 4 on-board outputs of the NCU.

The on-board outputs are assigned in order of increasing machine axis numbers (with assigned cam pairs).

Example:
Machine axis 3  = cam pair 1  --&gt;   on-board output 3
Machine axis 1  = cam pair 2  --&gt;   on-board output 1
Machine axis 7  = cam pair 3  --&gt;   on-board output 4
Machine axis 2  = cam pair 4  --&gt;   on-board output 2

If a plurality of cam pairs are set for one machine axis, then this axis is assigned in ascending order of the cam pairs.
Example:
Machine axis 3  = cam pair 1  --&gt;   on-board output 2
Machine axis 3  = cam pair 2  --&gt;   on-board output 3
Machine axis 7  = cam pair 3  --&gt;   on-board output 4
Machine axis 2  = cam pair 4  --&gt;   on-board output 1

This function works independently of the assignment set in MD10470 $MN_SW_CAM_ASSIGN_FASTOUT_1 or MD10471 $MN_SW_CAM_ASSIGN_FASTOUT_2.

Note:
	The on-board byte must not be used more than once.

If there is more than one signal change in the IPO cycle for the cam pairs specified in the MD, then the cam pair with the lowest number determines the instant of output. The other signals change at the same time.

Bit 0(LSB) = 0:
	If more than 1 signal change per interpolation cycle is due for the cams specified in MD10480 $MN_SW_CAM_TIMER_FASTOUT_MASK, the cam having the lowest number will determine the output instant. The other signals change at the same instant. That is, a maximum of one interrupt-controlled output is effected per interpolation cycle.

Bit 0(LSB) = 1:
	Each cam specified in MD10480 $MN_SW_CAM_TIMER_FASTOUT_MASK will be output precisely at the time of the interpolation cycle. There is no output priority of the cams. A maximum of 8 interrupt-controlled outputs can be performed per interpolation cycle.

Bit 1 = 0:
	Inversion of signal behavior from plus cam, where plus cam - minus cam &gt;= 180 degr.

Bit 1 = 1:
	No inversion of signal behavior from plus cam, where plus cam - minus cam &gt;= 180 degr.
	Signal behavior on-board output:
	Overtravelling:

	Traversing direction:
	positive   0-&gt;1          1-&gt;0
	negative   1-&gt;0          0-&gt;1

Bit 2 = 0:
	No path-time cam

Bit 2 = 1:
	Path-time cam for cams where minus position = plus position. The lead/delay time applied is independent of:
- velocity of the axis
- position of the axis
- reversal of traversing direction
	The cam is only activated on overtravelling of the cam position. A lead/delay time applied to the minus cam is active and leads to a shift of the whole cam.

Bit 3 = 0:
	No alignment signal in case of measurement area selection.

Bit 3 = 1:
	Output of an alignment signal for measurement area selection (FM only). On-board output 8 is used permanently.

Bit0 = 1
	Means that there is no stop in any internal ASUB block. Exception: The single block stop has been explicitly activated by the SBLON command.

	There are three different internal ASUBs that are triggered by different events.
	- Repos: In the case of the events: change of operating mode to a manual mode (JOG, JOGREF, etc.) unless MODESWITCH_MASK is not set, switch skip block on and off, activate machine data, switch-on overstore, axis replacement, subroutine level cancelation, switch-on single block, switch dry run feedrate on and off, alarm with compensation block.

	- Return: Delete distance-to-go, switchover after TEACH-IN (if available), or deselection of MDI with corresponding MODESWITCH_MASK.

	- _N_PROG_EVENT_SPF: Parameterizing MD 20108 $MC_PROG_EVENT_MASK parameterizes the events whereby _N_PROG_EVENT_SPF is executed.

Bit1 = 1
	Means that there is no stop in any user ASUB block. Exception: The single block stop has been explicitly activated via the SBLON command.
	User ASUBs are linked to an interrupt by the part program command SETINT or via the PI- _N_ASUP__. The interrupt is then activated via PLC or the high-speed inputs, and the user ASUBs are retracted.

	This disables machine data MD20117 $MC_IGNORE_SINGLEBLOCK_ASUP. The NCK behavior corresponds to the machine data assignment MD20117 $MC_IGNORE_SINGLEBLOCK_ASUP= FFFFFFFF.

Bit2 = 1
	Means that there is no stop in any intermediate block. Intermediate blocks are generated at, among other events, tool change, ADIS and complicated geometry.

Bit3 = 1
	Means that there is no stop in the block search pickup block. The block search pickup block is the 1st block that is loaded into the main run at the start after the search target has been found in the program.

Bit4 = 1
	Means that there is no stop in the INIT blocks. INIT blocks are generated from reset immediately after a part program start.

Bit5 = 1
	Means that there is no stop in any subprogram block with the parameter DISPLOF.

Bit6 = 1
	Means that there is no stop in any block in which the NCK cannot reorganize.

	Reorganize is an internal procedure that is needed for mode change after JOG/JOGREF..., switch skip block on and off, activate machine data, axis replacement, switch on overstore, switch on single block, switch dry run feedrate on and off, subroutine level cancelation, user ASUBs delete distance-to-go, switchover after TEACH-IN (if available). Reorganize is never needed in Reset state.

	Example blocks in which reorganize is impossible:
- Tool change
- 1st block after the Repos procedure
- Block after an ASUB from JOG/canceled

Bit7 = 1
	Means that there cannot be a stop in any block in which repositioning is impossible.

	Reposition is an internal procedure that is needed for mode change after JOG/JOGREF..., switch skip block on and off, activate machine data, axis replacement, switch on overstore, switch on single block, switch dry run feedrate on and off, subroutine level cancelation, and possibly user ASUBs. Reposition is never needed in Reset state.

	Example blocks in which reposition is impossible:

	- G33 + blocks in which reorganize is impossible.

Bit8 = 1
	Means that there is no stop in a residual block that does not contain traversing information.

Bit9 = 1
	Means that there is no stop in a run in/main run synchronization block (e.g.STOPRE, $Variable) that is repeated because of an interruption with Reorg (e.g. mode change).

Bit10= 1
	Means that there is no stop in a "tool selection block". "Tool selection block" only occurs with tool management (magazine management or TMMG) active. This block gives the corresponding tool change command to the PLC.
	This block is generally generated by T programming from the part program.
	Example block "N1010 T="Drill" M6 D1"

	Depending on machine data, the "tool selection block" can be held in the interpolator until the PLC has acknowledged the corresponding tool change (see MD20310 $MC_TOOL_MANAGEMENT_MASK). However the program status remains in "run".

Bit11= 1
	The control has to automatically generate implicit GET blocks for the axis replacement function (axis replacement: 2 or more channels control one axis alternately) if no explicit GET(D) has been programmed and the following block wants to traverse the axis. (The other channel had previously used this axis).

	An explicitly programmed GET may appear as follows "getd(x1,y1,z1) or get(x1,y1,z1)".

	There is no stop at explicit or implicit GET blocks in the single block with this bit 11.

Bit12= 1
	There is no stop in the single block type 2 in the SBLON block.

Bit13= 1
	If an axis is pulled out in the middle of a block and possibly assigned to another channel, then there is no stop at  the PREMATURE end of this block. This block follows a REPOSA in order to traverse it to the end, there is no stop until this end has been reached.

Bit14=1
	In a part program line, in which a substitution subroutine is called due to NC language replacement, only one stop is performed under the condition that the subroutine includes PROC attribute SBLOF. It is irrelevant whether the subroutine is called at block start and/or end or whether it is exited with M17 or RET.

Bit15=1
	Means that there is no stop in any user ASUB block. Exception: The single block stop has been explicitly activated via the SBLON command.

	There are three different internal ASUBs that are triggered by different events.
	- Repos: In the case of the events: change of operating mode to a manual mode (JOG, JOGREF,...) unless MODESWITCH_MASK is not set, switch skip block on and off, activate machine data, switch-on overstore, axis replacement, subroutine level cancelation, switch-on single block, switch dry run feedrate on and off, alarm with compensation block.

	- Return: Delete distance-to-go, switchover after TEACH-IN (if available), or deselection of MDI with corresponding MODESWITCH_MASK.

Bit16=1
	Activating SERUPRO (search run via prog test) prevents stopping at single blocks.

<brief>NC language commands of inactive options / functions</brief>
<description>Manner of handling language commands whose associated option or function has not been activated.
All programmable commands in an NC program or cycle program are language commands. Detailed information is available in the description of the language command STRINGIS.

Value	Meaning
 --------------------------------------------------------------
0:	All language commands are known - especially those whose function has not been activated. That means that all language commands are programmable. Whether the required function is active is not detected until execution. If not, then a specific alarm is generated.

Option approved / not approved (for functions without options "Option approved" applies implicitly):
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1:	All language commands are known. Language commands with options that have not been approved, are recognized at the beginning of the program interpretation and rejected with alarm 12553 "Option/function inactive".
	Example:
		If the option data for cylinder transformation has not been set, programming of TRACYL will be rejected with alarm 12553.

2:	Only those language commands are known that correspond to the current scope of approved NCK software options. This means that options that are not approved are rejected with 12550 "Name not defined or option/function not available". In this case it is not possible to decide whether the relevant command is not known in Siemens NC language in general or whether it is simply not available on this system.
	Example:
		If the option data for cylinder transformation has not been set, programming of TRACYL will be rejected with alarm 12550.

Function active/inactive:
 ----------------------------
3:	All language commands are known. Language commands with inactive functions are recognized at the beginning of the program interpretation and rejected with alarm 12553 "Option/function inactive".
	Example:
		If the option data for cylinder transformation has been set, but transformation has not been activated with MD24100 $MC_TRAFO_TYPE_1, programming of TRACYL will be rejected with alarm 12553.

4:	Only those language commands are known that correspond to the current scope of active NCK software functions. This means that any command regarding inactive functions are rejected with alarm 12550 "Name not defined or option/function not available". In this case it cannot be decided whether the relevant command is not known in the Siemens NC language in general or whether it is simply not available on this system.
	Example:
		If the option data for cylinder transformation has been set, but transformation has not been activated with MD24100 $MC_TRAFO_TYPE_1, programming of TRACYL will be rejected with alarm 12550.

The name of the subprogram is stated in MD10716 $MN_M_NO_FCT_CYCLE_NAME[n]. If the M function defined with MD10715 $MN_M_NO_FCT_CYCLE[n] is programmed in a part program block, the subprogram defined in MD10716 $MNM_NO_FCT_CYCLE_NAME[n] is started at the end of the block. If the M function is programmed again in the subprogram, there is no longer substitution by a subprogram call. MD10715 $MN_M_NO_FCT_CYCLE[n] acts both in Siemens mode G290 and in external language mode G291.

The subprograms configured with MD10716 $MN_M_NO_FCT_CYCLE_NAME[n] and MD10717 $MN_T_NO_FCT_CYCLE_NAME must not be active simultaneously in one block (line of a part program). This means that no more than one M/T function replacement can be active in any one block. Neither an M98 nor a modal subprogram call can be programmed in a block with the M function replacement.
Subprogram return and end of part program are also not permitted. Alarm 14016 is output in the event of a conflict.

Restrictions:
M functions with a fixed meaning and configurable M functions are checked for conflicting settings. A conflict is reported with an alarm.
The following M functions are checked:
- M0 to M5,
- M17, M30,
- M19,
- M40 to M45,

	Enables JOG in automatic.

	JOG is enabled in automatic when all channels in the mode group are in the RESET state and no channel of the DRF mode group has been selected. The mode group changes internally to JOG with the +/- key and the handwheel, and the axis moves. After the JOG motion has ended, a change back to AUTO is also made internally.

	The function 'JOG to position' considers all axial frames and, in the case of an axis configured as geometry axis, the tool length offset.

Bit 2:
	Travel in opposite direction.

	The functions 'JOG to position' and 'Approach machine fixed point manually' allow travel in opposite direction, i.e. away from the specified position.

Bit 3:

The default settings of the handwheel are path inputs. No pulses are lost. Residual axis motions occur as a result of the limitation to a maximal permissible velocity.

Value = 0:
The default settings of the handwheel are velocity inputs. The axes stop as soon as the handwheel stops. The motion is immediately braked if no pulses come from the handwheel in an interpolation cycle. Therefore, only a short residual motion of the axes can occur as a result of the braking ramp. The handwheel pulses do not supply a path default.

Value = 2:
The default settings of the handwheel are velocity inputs. The axes are intended to stop as soon as the handwheel stops. The motion is immediately braked if no pulses come from the handwheel in an interpolation cycle. However, in contrast to value = 0 braking is not along the shortest possible path but to the next possible point in an intended grid.
Each increment in the grid corresponds to a displacement which the selected axis travels per handwheel grid position (see MD31090 $MA_JOG_INCR_WEIGHT and

1: Content of MD11386 $MN_MONITOR_INPUT_INT is written in four NCU bytes from MD11380 $MN_MONITOR_ADDRESS.
2: Content of MD11388 $MN_MONITOR_INPUT_REAL is written in eight NCU bytes from MD11380 $MN_MONITOR_ADDRESS.

The content of MONITOR_INPUT_STROBE is reset to 0 after the takeover (no action). A new input can therefore be made immediately.

In order to familiarize oneself with this function, one should first leave MD11380 $MN_MONITOR_ADDRESS at its default value. One can then write data without causing damage.
Examples:
	MONITOR_INPUT_INT = 55AA
	MONITOR_INPUT_STROBE = 1
	=&gt; in MONITOR_DISPLAY_INT appears 55AA

	MONITOR_INPUT_REAL = 1.234
	MONITOR_INPUT_STROBE = 2
	=&gt; in MONITOR_DISPLAY_REAL appears 1.234

Caution!!!
	Writing data to unknown addresses can even destroy the NCK system program! That may have unforeseen consequences (danger to machine and people!). If the machine and those present survive such an action undamaged, the system program can usually be restored by power off/on.

<name>PLC_OB1_TRACE_DEPTH</name>
<brief>Buffer depth of PLC trace data at OB1</brief>
<description>Buffer depth of PLC trace data at OB1.

Multiple values of PLC data are buffered, between the time of collection in the PLC and the time of inspection in NCK.  Variables traced at "OB1" are collected once per complete PLC scan, but can only be inspected once per IPO cycle.

The buffer size must accomodate at least one more value than the total number of buffered values to be inspected.  This is to prevent NCK from inspecting a value that the PLC is in the process of collecting.

A good value to start with is one more than MD10074 $MN_PLC_IPO_TIME_RATIO.

The larger the buffer depth, the fewer PLC variables that can be traced, because there is a single, small, fixed pool of data slots for sending data samples from the PLC to NCK (64 data slots).  Every PLC variable being traced is allocated as many data slots from the pool as the value of the buffer depth.

This single pool of data slots is shared by data collected at OB1, OB35, and OB40 (even though the buffer depths of OB1, OB35, and OB40 can be configured to be different from one another).  It is also shared by all concurrent users of trace, even though the users might have no knowledge of one another.

Multiple values of PLC data are buffered, between the time of collection in the PLC and the time of inspection in NCK.  Variables traced at "OB40" are collected just when the PLC receives the special, programmably initiated OB40 interrupt from NCK, but can only be inspected once per IPO cycle.

The buffer size must accomodate at least one more value than the number of buffered values to be inspected.  This is to prevent NCK from inspecting a value that the PLC is in the process of collecting.

If the OB40 interrupt is issued less frequently than once per IPO cycle, then the OB40 buffer depth should be 2.  Otherwise it should be one more than the largest number of interrupts expected during any one IPO cycle.

<name>BAG_MASK</name>
<brief>Defines the mode group behavior</brief>
<description>This MD describes the effect of the VDI signals on the channels of a mode group (BAG) in respect of ASUBs and interrupt routines.
Bit no.  Hexadec.   Meaning when bit set
         value

Bit0:    0x0        Normal response to mode group signals in all channels of the mode group (as SW 3)
                    All channels switch into a program operating mode on interrupt.

Bit0:    0x1        No response of other mode group VDI signals in the channel in which an
                    interrupt handling (ASUB) is running. (BAG-RESET, BAG-STOP. individual block types
                    A and B, mode selection). Furthermore, there is an internal operating mode changeover
                    only in those channels which have received an interrupt request.

Bit1:    0x1        There is an internal operating mode changeover
                    only in those channels which have received an interrupt request.
                    This is similar to Bit0, however, mode group VDI signals effect the interrupt.

<name>ASUP_START_MASK</name>
<brief>Ignore stop conditions for ASUB</brief>
<description>This machine data defines which stop reasons are to be ignored on an ASUB start. The ASUB is started or the following stop reasons are ignored:

Bit 0:
	STOP reason: STOP key, M0 or M01
	An ASUB is started immediately if NCK is in RESET status (or JOG mode) (no ASUB can be started in RESET/JOG without this bit).
Bit 1:
	Reserved! This bit was replaced by MD20105 $MC_PROG_EVENT_IGN_REFP_LOCK and MD20115 $MC_IGNORE_REFP_LOCK_ASUP.
Bit 2:
	Start allowed even if a read-in disable is active; in other words, the blocks of the ASUB program are loaded and executed immediately. This therefore disables machine data MD20107 $MC_PROG_EVENT_IGN_INHIBIT and MD20116 $MC_IGNORE_INHIBIT_ASUP. The NCK behavior corresponds to the machine data assignment $MC_PROG_EVENT_IGN_INHIBIT=H3F $MC_IGNORE_INHIBIT_ASUP=HFFFFFFFF.
	If the bit is not set:
	The assignment of machine data MD20107 $MC_PROG_EVENT_IGN_INHIBIT and MD20116 $MC_IGNORE_INHIBIT_ASUP are evaluated.
	If the particular bit in $MC_PROG_EVENT_IGN_INHIBIT or $MC_IGNORE_INHIBIT_ASUP is 0, then although an ASUB or prog event are immediately internally initiated, the blocks of the ASUB program are only loaded when the read-in inhibit is withdrawn.
	The path is decelerated immediately when the ASUB is triggered (except with option BLSYNC).
	The read-in disable is set once more in the ASUB program.

Bit 3:
	Notice:
		The following function can always be activated in single-channel systems. Multi-channel systems require bit1 in MD11600 $MN_BAG_MASK in addition. The function is active o_n_l_y for those ASUBs that were activated from the cancelation program status (Reset channel status). The function is not active in multi-channel systems without MD11600 $MN_BAG_MASK bit1.

	If an ASUB is started automatically from JOG, the user may stop in the middle of the ASUB program. JOG mode is displayed continuously for the user. With bit 3 set, the user may jog in this situation. This is not possible without bit 3. In this case, mode change is locked with alarm 16927. By pressing the Start key, the user can continue the ASUB program. As long as the ASUB program is running, the user is naturally not able to jog. At the end of the ASUB program, the user may jog again.

Bit 4...15:	Reserved

The fixed feedrate is also evaluated in continuous-path mode in order to optimize the overhead for the Look Ahead calculation. Unnecessarily high values should therefore be avoided. Enter zero if a fixed feedrate is not wanted

In JOG mode:
After activating a fixed feedrate via an interface signal, and traversing the rotary axis with a traversing key, traversing proceeds in the selected direction with the fixed feedrate.

n = 0, 1, 2, 3 mean fixed feedrates 1, 2, 3, 4.

JOG: A spindle is traversed with a fixed feedrate by activating the traversing keys and activating the appropriate signals in the PLC interface.

The override is not active.
Depending upon MD12200 $MN_RUN_OVERRIDE_0, traversing also takes place with override 0.
The value defined by MD32000 $MA_MAX_AX_VELO is taken as the upper limit. If the fixed feedrate has a larger value, the aforementioned limiting value applies.

<brief>Central lubrication active</brief>
<description>When a settable axial path has been exceeded, the axial VDI signals request a lubrication pulse from the PLC (compare MD33050 $MA_LUBRICATION_DIST). These axial pulses act (by default) independently of each other.

If the machine construction requires a central lubrication, i.e. the lubrication pulse of any axis is acting on all axes, the corresponding path monitoring of all axes must be restarted after lubrication pulse output. This start synchronization of the monitoring is executed via MD12300 $MN_CENTRAL_LUBRICATION=TRUE.

<description>Configuration data is exchanged between the individual NCUs during NCK ramp-up. For this purpose, the NCUs involved in data replication must be synchronized in time. The machine data specifies timeouts for data exchange. In the case of Solutionline this is achieved via PROFINET communication. During ramp-up this is standard Ethernet communication; IRT communication takes over subsequently. The significance of the individual elements is as follows:
Element 0:  Timeout for the first synchronization for data replication during ramp-up
Element 1:  Timeout for synchronization for isochronous transition to cyclic operation
Element 2:  Timeout for a non-real-time telegram during ramp-up                    (Solutionline only)

<description>For PROFIdrive only:
Logical I/O addresses of the PROFIdrive drives on the PROFIBUS/PROFINET. An address is assigned to a drive.
This MD is the link to the description of the PROFIBUS/PROFINET configuration in SDB.
The MD value is the address index of the logical I/O drive address assigned with HW-Config (SIMATIC Manager S7).
Example:
DRIVE_LOGIC_ADDRESS[1] = 272 (The start address 272 is assigned to drive 1.)

The SDB defines the logical I/O address of the drives on the PROFIBUS/PROFINET. An address is assigned to a drive or to a slave.
The address index is used for actual-value and setpoint-value assignment
(MD30220 $MA_ENC_MODULE_NR[n], MD30110 $MA_CTRLOUT_MODULE_NR[n]).
Note:
The same drive (I/O address) must be assigned to the MD30220 $MA_ENC_MODULE_NR[0] and MD30110 $MA_CTRLOUT_MODULE_NR[0]
of a machine axis.
Each drive or slave must be assigned to a single logical address index.

The programmed edges of the sensor are independent of the electrical polarity, and are to be regarded as purely mechanical.

<name>MEAS_TYPE</name>
<brief>Meas. type with decentralized  drives</brief>
<description>For PROFIdrive only:
This MD sets the measuring function of decentralized drives.
The MD currently only functions for PROFIdrive drives.

MEAS_TYPE = 0 defines:
A probe is used that is connected centrally to the NC.
However, as the encoders only provide actual position values in cycles, the actual measuring position is found by interpolation.

MEAS_TYPE = 1 defines:
The probe must be wired decentralized to ALL drives.
The measuring functionality of the drive is then used,
saving the actual encoder values in the hardware at the time of the measuring edge.
This method is more accurate than that with MEAS_TYPE = 0, but it requires a more complex wiring and drives that support this measuring functionality (e.g. 611U).

<brief>Data source central measurement with PROFIBUS/PROFINET drives</brief>
<description>For PROFIBUS/PROFINET only:
Sets the method used to obtain the time stamps for central measurement with PROFIdrive drives.

For MEAS_CENTRAL_SOURCE = 1, the following applies:
  NRK access operations are used in order to access the onboard measuring register. For this purpose, the appropriate hardware, which permits this, must be available, e.g. for 840Di with MCI-Extension Board.

For MEAS_CENTRAL_SOURCE = 2, the following applies:
  The SINAMICS DO1 telegram is used (telegram types 391 and 395), and more specifically in the "Cyclic measurement" version without handshake.
  For this purpose, an integrated SINAMICS must be available, e.g. NCU 710.
  For measurement without handshake, two probes must be available in drive parameters p0680 index 0 and 1.

For MEAS_CENTRAL_SOURCE = 3, the following applies:
  The SINAMICS DO1 telegram is used (telegram type 391), and more specifically in a version with handshake. This technique is fault-tolerant, however, it only permits a measurement edge every 4 PROFIBUS/PROFINET cycles, i.e. it is therefore significantly slower.
  For this purpose, an integrated SINAMICS must be available, e.g. NCU 710.

  This MD is only relevant, if MD13210 $MN_MEAS_TYPE == 0.

<name>MEAS_PROBE_DELAY_TIME</name>
<brief>Delay time between probe deflection and recognition</brief>
<description>For probes with e.g. radio transmission, the probe deflection can be detected in the NC only with delay.
With this MD, the transmission link delay between the probe deflection and its detection is set in the control.
The measured value is corrected internally by the control by the distance that corresponds to the traversing motion during this time before measuring (modeling).
It is practicable to set values only up to a maximum of 15 position controller cycles.
Anyhow, the modeling could not work with the expected accuracy with values greater than that. In this case, the input value is therefore limited internally by the software to 15 position controller cycles (without any further feedback).

<brief>Depth of log memory optimization in REORG</brief>
<description>The depth of memory optimization in the REORG log file
(=search depth to determine if a parameter to be written is already included in the REORG log file).
The value of the machine data can be increased if alarm 15110 occurs during program execution and if this alarm is to be avoided.
(Alternatively, the size of the REORG log file can be increased with MD28000 $MC_MM_REORG_LOG_FILE_MEM, provided that the operator has the access rights required. This procedure should generally be preferred.)

Value
0       = No optimization,
	That is each write operation creates an input into the REORG log file. Writing a variable value is therefore very time-efficient, but requires more memory.
0&lt; n &lt;= Maximum value
	When a new variable value is written, the n previously entered write operations (but maximally up to the previous indicatable block) are checked to determine if the parameter now to be written has already been written in the past. If this is the case, a new entry is not made in the REORG log file.
	If this is not the case, an entry is made. A variable value can therefore be written in a very memory-efficient way, but requires more time.

Example:
MD17600 $MN_DEPTH_OF_LOGFILE_OPT is assumed to be 5 and the following would be a typical program sequence:

<name>DEPTH_OF_LOGFILE_OPT_PF</name>
<brief>Depth of the PowerFail log memory optimization</brief>
<description>Depth of the memory optimization in the PowerFail log file (=search depth, to find out
whether a parameter to be written is already included in the PowerFail log file).
It is possible to increase the value of the machine data if
alarm 15120 occurs during program processing and if you wish to avoid it.

(Alternatively, you can increase the size of the PowerFail log file itself
by means of MD18232 $MN_MM_ACTFILESYS_LOG_FILE_MEM, if you have the necessary access right
and if the required memory is available.

Value
0       = same effect as value 1.
          Writing of a variable value is therefore very time-efficient at the
          cost of the required memory.

0&lt; n &lt;= Maximum value
        = Writing of a new variable value leads, prior to saving of the new
          variable value in the PowerFail log file, to the last n write
          operations which have been being checked to see whether
          the new parameter to be written has already been written once.
          If yes, the new value is not entered again in the PowerFail log
          file, but the old value is overwritten with the new one.
          If no, the new value is entered.
          At the cost of the required time, writing of a variable value
          can therefore be designed very memory-efficiently.

Changing of the data can shorten/increase the time requirement of the present application.
Changing of the data can fill the available log buffers faster/more slowly.
Frequent occuring of alarm 15120 -&gt; Increase values for index=0,1,2.
The value indicating the index to be changed can be deducted from the parameter of alarm 15120:
if it is the value for MD18232 $MN_MM_ACTFILESYS_LOG_FILE_MEM[0], then increase the value for index 0;
or increase MD18232 $MN_MM_ACTFILESYS_LOG_FILE_MEM[0] itself.
Index Meaning
0     Search depth in preprocessing buffer
1     Search depth in buffer for data changes within the range of tool change
2     Search depth in buffer for data changes of main processing (especially synchronized actions)

<name>INFO_FREE_MEM_DYNAMIC</name>
<brief>Display data of free dynamic memory</brief>
<description>The data is used for
a)	the manufacturer's presetting of the memory size [ bytes ] available to the user for each channel after cold restart.
b)	Displaying the available dynamic memory [ bytes ]
	The data cannot be written.

The contents of the data state how much unbuffered memory is available per channel for increasing the unbuffered user data storage area via MD.
One should check whether the available memory is sufficient before increasing, for example, the number of LUDs, number of functional parameters, or the size of the IPO buffer.
If necessary, proceed step by step:
- increase by 1, note (old) value
- NCK startup (= 'warm start' or NCK reset), read off new value
- memory requirement = new value - old value

On the first NCK startup or cold restart of the control (=deletion of user data), MD18210 $MN_MM_USER_MEM_DYNAMIC is set by the NCK software so that at least the preset value results for MD18050 $MN_INFO_FREE_MEM_DYNAMIC.
That is, the value is automatically increased if the initial value of MD18210 $MN_MM_USER_MEM_DYNAMIC is too low.
The following also applies to multichannel systems:
- The preset value applies to each possible channel. That is, if there are ten possible channels, MD18210 $MN_MM_USER_MEM_DYNAMIC is set by the NCK SW so that at least the 'preset value* ten' results for MD18050 $MN_INFO_FREE_MEM_DYNAMIC.
- On activation of a channel, MD18210 $MN_MM_USER_MEM_DYNAMIC is increased if necessary so that the memory free at the time of activation continues to be free (provided that the memory structure permits this) after the channel has become active.
- The activation of the maximum possible number of axes is ensured by increasing the data MD18210 $MN_MM_USER_MEM_DYNAMIC if necessary so that memory free at the time of activation continues to be free (provided that the memory structure permits this) after the axis has become active.

'If necessary' in the previous sentences means that the adjustment is automatic if the channel/axis could not be activated with the current values of MD18210 $MN_MM_USER_MEM_DYNAMIC/$MN_INFO_FREE_MEM_DYNAMIC.

<description>The preassigned value specifies how many bytes, as a minimum, are free for the user when the NCK runs up with a 'cold start'.

The contents of the data state how much buffered memory is available for the passive file system when it runs up.
After a non-buffered run up, the maximum memory available in the file system can be read.
If MDs that influence the requirement for buffered memory are changed, the size of the memory available for the passive file system changes, as the memory size, which is allocated to the passive file system, comprises MD18230 $MN_MM_USER_MEM_BUFFERED minus all of the other buffered user data.
e.g. MD18150 $MN_MM_GUD_VALUES_MEM
e.g. MD38000 $MA_MM_ENC_COMP_MAX_POINTS)
(also refer to the documentation on MD18350 $MN_MM_USER_FILE_MEM_MINIMUM)

At the first NCK power up or cold restart of the control (=deletion of user data) MD18230 $MN_MM_USER_MEM_BUFFERED is set by the NCK software so that at least the default value results for MD18060 $MN_INFO_FREE_MEM_STATIC.
This means that MD18230 $MN_MM_USER_MEM_BUFFERED is automatically increased if its initial value is too low.

(The size of the passive file system is dimensioned using the MD18350 $MN_MM_USER_FILE_MEM_MINIMUM[0].)
Machine data for setting the active file system (tools, GUDs, ...) can be increased until this memory has all been allocated.

Bit 7 (=0x80) also has be set in MD18080 $MN_MM_TOOL_MANAGEMENT_MASK for the setting to become active.

Adapter data blocks and the cutting edge-specific basic/adapter dimensions are mutually exclusive. This means that if adapter data are defined, then the parameters $TC_DP21, $TC_DP22, $TC_DP23 and their values are generally not available in the NCK.

-1:
An adapter is automatically assigned to each magazine location.
This means that internally the same number of adapters are provided as magazine locations are provided by MD18086 $MN_MM_NUM_MAGAZINE_LOCATION.

<name>MM_USER_MEM_DYNAMIC</name>
<brief>User memory in DRAM [KB]</brief>
<description>The D-RAM in the NC is used jointly by the system and the user.
MD18210 $MN_MM_USER_MEM_DYNAMIC defines the size of the D-RAM available to the user. The input limits depend on the hardware and software configurations of the CNC.
There are various types of user data in this memory area, for example.
- Local user data
- Ipo block buffers
- User macros
- Diagnostics functions such as trace recording of times,.....
- Tool management trace
- Communication with 1-n HMIs; Value of n: See MD10134 $MN_MM_NUM_MMC_UNITS.
- Reorg Log file (required for internal purposes of the NC program sequence)
-  ...
Each additionally active channel occupies a substantial amount of memory here.
Each activated axis requires part of this memory.
Exactly how much that is, depends largely on the control model and the software version.

The settable values depend on the hardware and software configurations.

The value of NCK is automatically set after unbuffered runup of the NCK or deletion of the memory. The value is then such that the free memory defined in MD18050 $MN_INFO_FREE_MEM_DYNAMIC is available to the user.
(See the description of MD18050 $MN_INFO_FREE_MEM_DYNAMIC).

If the value is set too high (in the sense that the memory required is more than that
available on the memory card), the NCK responds at the next NCK reset/power on by automatically reducing the machine data value to the maximum possible value that the hardware permits.
(Message) alarm 6030 advises of this process. This corresponds to a correct response of the NCK.

The essential significance of the machine data is not to release the entire memory to the user because the memory is shared between the system and the user. Part of the physically existing memory is reserved for future developments of the NCK.

The maximum amount of memory available on the hardware can be found by selecting a value for the data that is so large that, after the subsequent  restart, message alarm 6030 indicates the maximum available memory. Applications that use the maximum available memory will in all probability have memory problems with a software conversion to a newer NCK version.

Upper and lower limits are not necessary. The software rejects values outside the permissible range and then automatically sets suitable values.
(See also message alarm 6030.

The data in the dynamic memory are not buffered.

Note:
	At power on, the system software compares the sum of all requests for dynamic memory with the value in MD18210 $MN_MM_USER_MEM_DYNAMIC. Alarm 6000 "Memory allocated with standard machine data" is output if the memory required exceeds the memory capacity set with the MD. Alarm 6030 "User memory limit has been adapted" is output if the control detects that the memory capacity required by MD18210 $MN_MM_USER_MEM_DYNAMIC is larger than the physical memory when it powers up.

Corresponds with:
	The available dynamic memory can be taken from MD18050 $MN_INFO_FREE_MEM_DYNAMIC (display data of the free dynamic memory).

<name>MM_USER_MEM_BUFFERED</name>
<brief>User memory in SRAM</brief>
<description>Battery-backed user memory (in kbyte).
Various types of user data are stored in this memory area.
For example:
- NC part programs
- R variables
- Global user data (GUD)
- Definitions of the protection zones
- Correction tables EEC, CEC, QEC
- Tool / magazine data
        ...
This data is retained after control power off.
(Provided the data backup (battery,...) is in good working order and the Init switch is correctly set on the control).
This means that they are available unchanged after restart.

In the case of control models without a backup battery (e.g. 802S,...) there is, as a rule, an option of , specifically backing up the data by operation, so that they are available again after the next power on process.

The settable values depend on the hardware and software configurations.
The set values are designed for the minimum memory configuration of the particular control model.

256, 512 and 2000, 4000KB of battery-backed memory are available on the hardware.
Approximately 30KB of this physically present memory is used for internal purposes. This means that approximately 226, 482, 1970, 3970KB of user memory can be set.

After all the NCK functions have taken 'their' memory corresponding to the relevant machine data values, the rest of the memory is added to the part program memory. As a rule, the user will thus have more part program memory available than that guaranteed in the sales brochure. This 'more' may however vary from version to version.

If there are various memory configuration options for a control model then the data may have to be increased correspondingly when using the larger memory variants.
In this respect, see the meaning of  MD18060 $MN_INFO_FREE_MEM_STATIC
Special cases:
	The battery-backed data are lost if this machine data is altered.

<name>MM_ACTFILESYS_LOG_FILE_MEM</name>
<brief>System: logfile size in SRAM [KB]</brief>
<description>Buffered log file for buffered data of the active file system ( in kbytes )
Systems with slow data buffer media store changed buffered data in the internal system SRAM. When the buffer is full, all data of the active file system are made persistent. The buffer backs up the data persistence of the last persistence operation until the next power fail. After a power fail (power failure or power OFF), data that had not yet been made persistent at the time of the power fail can be restored from this buffer.
The log file serves to minimize or totally avoid data loss in the event of power fail.
1000 entries require approximately 70 kB.
A value greater than 0 is only practicable if MD18231 $MN_MM_USER_MEM_BUFFERED_TYPEOF[1] = 1.
A value equal to 0 means that the buffered data are not voltage loss safe
if MD18231 $MN_MM_USER_MEM_BUFFERED_TYPEOF[1] = 1 (typical for SINUMERIK solution line)
Example:
With MD18232 $MN_MM_ACTFILESYS_LOG_FILE_MEM[2] = 0, data changes from synchronized actions can be excluded from the power fail data backup.
An improved time response of the synchronized actions would be advantageous. This should only be set if the buffered data that are changed by the synchronized action are not safety-relevant.
Index Meaning
0     Preprocessing buffer
1     Buffer for data changes within the range of the tool change
2     Buffer for data changes of the main processing (especially synchronized actions)

<name>MM_MAX_SIZE_OF_LUD_VALUE</name>
<brief>Maximum memory block size for LUD/GUD values</brief>
<description>Defines the net memory array size for LUD/GUD variables. Each NC program that defines at least one LUD/GUD variable or has call parameters then occupies at least one memory array of this size.
The LUD/GUD variables of a program may occupy the complete LUD/GUD value memory set for the channel. However, then there is no memory available for other programms.
The memory for the LUD/GUD variables (that is defined for LUD by the channel-specific MD28040 $MC_MM_LUD_VALUES_MEM and for GUD by the NCK-specific MD18150 $MN_MM_GUD_VALUES_MEM) is divided into equally sized arrays of the size MD18242 $MN_MM_MAX_SIZE_OF_LUD_VALUE.

Example:
MM_LUD_VALUES_MEM = 12 (kbytes gross)
MM_MAX_SIZE_OF_LUD_VALUE = 660 (bytes net)
                          + 16 (bytes management data per array)
                          --------------------------------------
                           676 (bytes gross)
One then obtains 12*1024 / 676 = 18 memory arrays each of 660 bytes.
This means that 12 NC programs can either each occupy one array or one NC program can define, for example, 18 variables of type Frame (whose size is approximately 660 bytes.

Data type            Memory requirement
REAL                        8 bytes
INT                         4 bytes
BOOL                        1 byte
CHAR                        1 byte
STRING                      1 byte per character,
                                   100 characters are possible per string
AXIS                        4 bytes
FRAME                up to 1 kbyte (depending on control model)

Warning:
	The battery-backed data are lost when this machine data is changed!
	The size of the NC language type Frame depends on the maximum number of channel axes generated by the NCK.
	There are NCK systems with a maximum number of channel axes from 4 to 20. In the case of 20 axes, the type Frame then has a size of 660 bytes.

<name>MM_SERVO_FIFO_SIZE</name>
<brief>Setpoint value for buffer size between IPO and position control</brief>
<description>The machine data determines the size of the setpoint value buffer between interpolator and position control, and has a direct effect on the dynamic user memory requirement.

That is normally 2. If several NCUs are connected via NCU link for e.g. rotary indexing machines, the value should be set to 3 on all NCUs. This will balance the transmission rates of the setpoint values via the link.

In a master value application (e.g. line shaft), the value should be set to 4, but only on the NCU that generates the master value. For all the other NCUs, the preset value should be maintained at 2.

Note:
In control loops that are connected via interpolator, every increase of the value generates a further dead-time.

When the IPO cycles of the NCUs within an NCU group are set to different values, the link communication will only run in the slowest IPO cycle. The MD must be increased in the ratio of the NCU IPO cycle to the slowest IPO cycle in the NCU group, in order to achieve a synchronized output of the setpoint values on the drive interface. The formula for this is as follows:
MM_SERVO_FIFO_SIZE = 2 * IPO cycle ratio + 1

Example:
In an IPO cycle ratio of 4:1, the value on the fast NCU should be set to 9 instead of 3. On the slow NCU, the value must be set to 3.

<brief>Type of positioning axis dynamic response</brief>
<description>The machine data deterrmines the accelerations and jerks which are applied in the case of positioning axis motion.

Value 0:
The acceleration is taken from the first field entry in MD32300  $MA_MAX_AX_ACCEL (value for DYNNORM).
With G75 and active jerk limitation (SOFT), the jerk is taken from the first field entry in MD32431 $MA_MAX_AX_JERK (value for DYNNORM); without jerk limitation (BRISK) it is infinite.
The following applies for all other positioning axis movements:
If MD32420 $MA_JOG_AND_POS_JERK_ENABLE is true, the jerk is taken from MD32430 $MA_JOG_AND_POS_MAX_JERK; otherwise it is infinite (BRISK behavior).
Value 1:
The acceleration is taken from the second field entry in MD32300 $MA_MAX_AX_ACCEL (value for DYNPOS).
The jerk is taken from the second field entry in MD32431 $MA_MAX_AX_JERK (value for DYNPOS).
