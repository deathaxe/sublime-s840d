<name>JOG_VAR_INCR_SIZE</name>
<brief>Size of the variable increment for JOG</brief>
<description>This setting data defines the number of increments when variable increment (INCvar) is selected. This increment size is traversed by the axis in JOG mode each time the traverse key is pressed or the handwheel is turned one detent position and variable increment is selected (PLC interface signal "Active machine function: INC variable" for machine or geometry axes is set to 1). The defined increment size also applies to DRF.

Note:
	Please note that the increment size is active for incremental jogging and handwheel jogging. So, if a large increment value is entered and the handwheel is turned, the axis might cover a large distance (depends on setting in MD31090 $MA_JOG_INCR_WEIGHT).

<description>1:	Jog mode for JOG continuous
	In jog mode (default setting) the axis traverses as long as the traverse key is held down and an axis limitation has not been reached. When the key is released the axis is decelerated to zero speed and the movement is considered complete.

0:	Continuous operation for JOG continuous
	In continuous operation the traverse movement is started with the first rising edge of the traverse key and continues to move even after the key is released. The axis can be stopped again by pressing the traverse key again (second rising edge).

<description>Value not equal to 0:
The velocity entered applies to rotary axes in JOG mode (to continuous jogging, incremental  jogging, jogging with handwheel). The value entered is common to all rotary axes, and must not exceed the maximum permissible axis velocity (MD32000 $MA_MAX_AX_VELO).

<brief>Weighting factor compensation table</brief>
<description>The compensation value stored in the table [t] is multiplied by the weighting factor.
When selecting the weighting factor it should be ensured that the total compensation value in the compensation axis does not exceed the maximal value of

If, for example, the weight of the tools used on the machine or the workpieces to be machined are too different and this affects the error curve by changing the amplitude, this can be corrected by changing the weighting factor. In the case of sag compensation, the weighting factor in the table can be changed for specific tools or workpieces from the PLC user program or the NC program by overwriting the setting data. However, different compensation tables are to be used if the course of the error curve is substantially changed by the different weights.

<name>COMPAR_THRESHOLD_1</name>
<brief>Threshold value of the 1st comparator</brief>
<description>COMPAR_THRESHOLD_1[b] defines the threshold values for the individual input bits [b] of comparator byte 1.

The output bit n of the 1st comparator is created by comparing the threshold value n according to the comparison type defined in bit n of COMPAR_TYPE_1.

For example:
	COMPAR_ASSIGN_ANA_INPUT_1[2] = 4
	COMPAR_TRESHOLD_1[2]         = 5000.0
	COMPAR_TYPE_1                = 5
	The 3rd output bit of comparator 1 is set if the input value at AnalogIn 4 is greater than or equal to 5 volts.

<name>SINGULARITY_THRESHOLD</name>
<brief>Threshold value for singularity detection.</brief>
<description>This SD specifies the threshold value for detecting singularities in the programmed blocks.
If the values of this SD are too high, unnecessary singularity handlings will be performed, which can also lead to unnecessary contour deviations.
If the values of this SD are too low, not all singular positions will be detected and handled.
The value 2.0e-6 is recommended.
