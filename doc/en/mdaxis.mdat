<parameter number="30242" type="BYTE" dim="1">
<name>ENC_IS_INDEPENDENT</name>
<brief>Encoder is independent</brief>
<description>If actual value corrections performed by the NC on the encoder selected for position control are not to influence the actual value of any other encoder defined in the same axis, then the position control encoder must be declared to be "independent".
Actual value corrections include the following:
- Modulo treatment,
- Reference point approach,
- Measuring system calibration,
- PRESET
Example:
MD30200 $MA_NUM_ENCS[ AX1 ] = 2
MD30242 $MA_ENC_IS_INDEPENDENT[ 0, AX1 ] = 0
MD30242 $MA_ENC_IS_INDEPENDENT[ 1, AX1 ] = 1
When the VDI interface has selected the first encoder for position control, the above mentioned actual value corrections will be executed on this encoder only.
When the VDI interface has selected the second encoder for position control, the above mentioned actual value corrections will be executed on both encoders.
The machine data is therefore only valid for encoders that have not been selected by the VDI interface for positon control (passive encoders).

As from SW5, the scope of functions has been extended:
MD30242 $MA_ENC_IS_INDEPENDENT = 2
The passive encoder is dependent. The active encoder changes the actual encoder value. In combination with MD34102 $MA_REFP_SYNC_ENCS = 1, the passive encoder is adjusted to the active encoder during reference point approach, but is NOT referenced.
In reference mode MD34200 $MA_ENC_REFP_MODE = 3 (distance-coded reference marks), the passive encoder is automatically referenced with the next traversing movement after zero mark distance overtravel. This is done independently of the current mode setting.
MD30242 $MA_ENC_IS_INDEPENDENT = 3
In contrast to MD30242 $MA_ENC_IS_INDEPENDENT = 1, modulo actual value corrections are executed in the passive encoder of modulo rotary axes.

<name>ACT_POS_ABS</name>
<brief>Internal encoder position</brief>
<description>The actual position (hardware counter status only without machine reference) is stored (in internal format display) in this MD.
At power ON (or encoder activation), it acts with:

- Absolute encoders:
	To restore the current position (in combination with the position, possibly with several meanings, buffered in the encoder).
- Incremental encoders:
	To buffer the actual value beyond power OFF when the functionality is activated MD34210 $MA_ENC_REFP_STATE = 1 or. 2 (i.e. as a reference point replacement).
	To buffer the actual value beyond power OFF when the functionality is activated MD34210 $MA_ENC_REFP_STATE = 3 (i.e. as a restored position value).

Note:
	This MD is changed internally by the control during traversing movements. Loading a previously saved MD data block can therefore destroy the encoder calibration (machine position reference) of absolute encoders.
	For software conversions, we recommend removing the MD data block from the old software release prior to conversion and reloading it into the new software release without moving any axis in the meantime. Protection level 1 should be set for SW 3.6; protection level 2  suffices for SW 4 and higher. The encoder calibration must be explicitly verified (controlled, calibrated) after the software conversion.

<name>ENC_ABS_BUFFERING</name>
<brief>Absolute encoder: Traversing range extension</brief>
<description>This MD defines the way in which the absolute encoder position is buffered, and whether a traversing range extension is active in the software (exceeding the limits of the absolute encoder range that can be displayed on the hardware).

"0" = standard = traversing range extension (compare ACT_POS_ABS) is active.
"1" = traversing range extension in the software is inactive.
When using an absolute linear scale, there will not be a traversing range overflow for mechanical reasons. This MD is therefore only valid for rotary absolute encoders.
For rotary absolute encoders, the traversing range that can be clearly displayed on the encoder side is stored in MD34220 $MA_ENC_ABS_TURNS_MODULO. You can do without a traversing range extension without any problems (a hardware counter overflow that might be within the traversing range is concealed in the software via shortest-path decision):

a.	in linear axes or limited rotary axes, if the actual traversing range on the load side is smaller than the traversing range on the load side that corresponds to MD34220 $MA_ENC_ABS_TURNS_MODULO.

b.	in endlessly turning rotary axes (ROT_IS_MODULO = TRUE), if the absolute encoder is connected on the load side (no gear to be considered) or if "without remainder" can be calculated:

Number of rotations on the load side = ENC_ABS_TURNS_MODULO * gear ratio

(Example: ENC_ABS_TURNS_MODULO = 4096 encoder rotations, gear 25:32, i.e. number of rotations on load side = 4096*(25/32)=3200).
Notice:
	If the conditions under a. or b. are not met, there is a risk of getting a wrong absolute encoder position at next Power ON or encoder activation after parking without prewarning if the traversing range extension is not working. Therefore, the traversing range extension remains active in the standard version.

If MD31700 $MA_ENC_EDS_ACTIVE = 1, a traversing range extension is not possible. Alarm 26017 therefore requests the traversing range extension to be switched off with a rotary absolute encoder with reference to this machine data.
If the traversing range extension is essential (because for example the conditions stated under b. for deactivation are not fulfilled), MD31700 $MA_ENC_EDS_ACTIVE must not be activated.

<brief>Servo gain factor</brief>
<description>Position controller gain, or servo gain factor.
The input/output unit for the user is [ (m/min)/mm].
I.e. MD32200 $MA_POSCTRL_GAIN[n] = 1 corresponds to a 1 mm following error at V = 1m/min.
The following machine data have default settings for adapting the standard selected input/output unit to the internal unit [rev/s].

- MD10220 $MN_SCALING_USER_DEF_MASK = 0x200; (bit no 9 as hex value).

If the value "0" is entered the position controller is opened.
When entering the servo gain factor it is important to take into account that the gain factor of the whole position control loop is still dependent on other parameters of the controlled system. A distinction should be made between a "desired servo gain factor" (MD32200 $MA_POSCTRL_GAIN) and an "actual servo gain factor" (produced by the machine). Only when all the parameters of the control loop are matched will these servo gain factors be the same.

Other factors are:
- Speed setpoint adjustment (MD32260 $MA_RATED_VELO, MD32250 $MA_RATED_OUTVAL)
  or automatic speed setpoint interface adjustment (with MD32250 $MA_RATED_OUTVAL = 0 etc.)
- Correct actual value recording of the position encoder (no. of encoder pulses, high resolution, encoder mounting location, gear etc.)
- Correct actual speed recording on the drive (standardization, possibly tacho compensation, tacho generator)

Note:
Axes which interpolate together and are to perform a machining operation, must either have the same gain setting (i.e. have the identical following error = 45° slope at the same velocity) or they must be matched via MD32910 $MA_DYN_MATCH_TIME.
The actual servo gain factor can be checked by means of the following error (in the service display).
In the case of analog axes, a drift compensation must be performed prior to the control.

Scaling of the manipulated variable with analog drives:
The value of the speed setpoint in percent is to be entered in this MD, in relation to the maximum speed setpoint at which the motor speed specified in MD32260 $MA_RATED_VELO[n] is reached.

Related to:
	MD32250 $MA_RATED_OUTVAL[n] only makes sense in combination with MD32260 $MA_RATED_VELO[n].
Example:
1.	At a voltage of 5V, the drive reaches a speed of
	1875 rpm ==&gt; RATED_OUTVAL = 50%, RATED_VELO = 11250 [degrees/s]
2.	At a voltage of 8V, the drive reaches a speed of
	3000 rpm ==&gt; RATED_OUTVAL = 80%, RATED_VELO = 18000 [degrees/s]
3.	At a voltage of 1.5V, the drive reaches a speed of
	562.5 rpm ==&gt; RATED_OUTVAL = 15%, RATED_VELO = 3375 [degrees/s]

All three examples are possible for one and the same drive/converter. The ratio of the two values is decisive; it is the same in all three examples.

MD32250 $MA_RATED_OUTVAL and MD32260 $MA_RATED_VELO describe physical properties of converter and drive; they can therefore only be determined by means of a measurement or commissioning instructions (converter, drive).

b.)
Scaling of the manipulated variable with digital PROFIdrive drives:
Default value "0" declares MD32250 $MA_RATED_OUTVAL and MD32260 $MA_RATED_VELO as invalid. Scaling of the manipulated variable is automatically determined and adjusted from the drive parameters instead.
Otherwise (MD32250 $MA_RATED_OUTVAL unequal to zero), the scaling of the manipulated variable is not determined from the drive (for example non-Siemens PROFIdrive drives), but set with RATED_VELO and RATED_OUTVAL, even in the case of these, irrespective of the scaling active on the drive side. In this case, the following applies:

Scaling of the manipulated variable on the drive = RATED_VELO / RATED_OUTVAL

Further scalings from drive parameters, such as torque scaling, are not active if  MD32250 $MA_RATED_OUTVAL is not equal to zero, the values based on it remain zero.

In the case of simultaneous operation of analog and PROFIdrive drives, the settings for the analog axes must be adjusted as described in a.).

<brief>Reset behavior of dynamic response limitation.</brief>
<description>MD32320 $MA_DYN_LIMIT_RESET_MASK is used to set the reset response of functions limiting dynamic response for specific axes and groups.
The MD is bit-coded, bit 0 (LSB) and bit 1 are currently allocated.

Bit 0 = 0:
	Programmed ACC, VELOLIM and JERKLIM are reset to 100% with channel reset/M30 if the channel-specific MD22410 $MC_F_VALUES_ACTIVE_AFTER_RESET is also zero.
	For spindle mode, programmed ACC and VELOLIM are reset to 100% with channel reset/M30 if MD35040 $MA_SPIND_ACTIVE_AFTER_RESET is zero and the channel-specific MD22400 $MC_S_VALUES_ACTIVE_AFTER_RESET is also zero.

<description>Enables the function of an axial jerk limitation.

<brief>Filter type for axial jerk limitation</brief>
<description>Filter type for axial jerk limitation:
1:	2nd order filter
2:	Moving averaging
3:	Bandstop filter
4:	Double moving averaging
5:	FIR low pass
Two-character parameterization activates switchable filter chains e.g.
25:	switchable filter chain with jerk filters of type 5 and type 2

Notes on parameterization:
MD32402 $MA_AX_JERK_MODE is only effective if MD32400 $MA_AX_JERK_ENABLE is set to 1.

Type1 requires the setting of
MD32410 $MA_AX_JERK_TIME
Recommended values from min: 0.03 s to max. 0.06 s
Type 1 is offered for compatibility reasons, type 2 is recommended

Type 2 requires the setting of
MD32410 $MA_AX_JERK_TIME
Recommended values from min: 1 position-control cycle to max: 127 position-control cycles. At 2 ms for a position-control cycle this corresponds to from 0.002 s to 0.254 s.
Type 2 requires more computing time than type 1, but causes smaller contour errors for the same smoothing effect, or smoother movements with the same accuracy.

Type 3 requires the setting of
MD32410 $MA_AX_JERK_TIME
MD32412 $MA_AX_JERK_FREQ
MD32414 $MA_AX_JERK_DAMP.
To parameterize a pure bandstop filter, it is recommended to set MD32410 $MA_AX_JERK_TIME=0
, whereby "denominator frequency = numerator frequency = blocking frequency = MD32412 $MA_AX_JERK_FREQ" is set automatically.
Whereas with MD32410 $MA_AX_JERK_TIME &gt; 0 a separate denominator frequency is set so that a bandstop filter can be implemented with an increased amplitude at frequencies above the blocking frequency.

Type 4 corresponds to two type 2 filters connected in series, and therefore requires the setting of
MD32410 $MA_AX_JERK_TIME
MD32411 $MA_AX_JERK_TIME_ADD

Type 5 requires the setting of
MD32407 $MA_AX_JERK_FIR_FREQ
MD32408 $MA_AX_JERK_FIR_ORDER
MD32409 $MA_AX_JERK_FIR_WINDOW

Two character parameterization activates switchable filter chains e.g.
type 25 complements type 5 with a switchable alternative type 2
The parameterization is made in index 0 of the parameters for type 5 and in index 1 of the parameters for type 2.

A runtime adaptation of the switchable filter chains is possible in the indices 0 and 1 of MD32895 $MA_DESVAL_DELAY_TIME if this is enabled by MD32890 $MA_DESVAL_DELAY_ENABLE.

<brief>Weighting of friction compensation value with short travel motions.</brief>
<description>The optimum friction compensation value determined by the circularity test can cause overcompensation of this axis if compensation is activated and axial positioning movements are short.

In such cases, a better setting can be achieved by reducing the amplitude of the friction compensation value and acts on all positioning blocks that are made within an interpolation cycle of the control.

The factor that has to be entered can be determined empirically and can be different from axis to axis because of the different friction conditions. The input range is between 0 and 100% of the value determined by the circularity test.

The default setting is 0; so that no compensation is performed for short traversing movements.

<brief>Feedforward control factor f. velocity/speed feedforward control</brief>
<description>Weighting factor for feedforward control. Is normally = 1.0 on digital drives, since these keep the setpoint speed exactly .
On analog drives, this factor can be used to compensate the gain error of the drive actuator, so that the actual speed becomes exactly equal to the setpoint speed (this reduces the following error with feedforward control).

On both drive types, the effect of the feedforward control can be continuously reduced with a factor of &lt; 1.0, if the machine moves too abruptly and other measures (e.g. jerk limitation) are not to be used. This also reduces possibly existing overshoots; however, the error increases on curved contours, e.g. on a circle. With 0.0, you have a pure position controller without feedforward control.

Contour monitoring takes into account factors &lt; 1.0.
In individual cases, it can, however, become necessary to increase MD CONTOUR_TOL.

<description>FFW_MODE defines the feedforward control mode to be applied on an axis-specific basis:

2 = Torque feedforward control (only for SINAMICS) with PT1 balancing
3 = Speed feedforward control with Tt balancing
4 = Torque feedforward control (only for SINAMICS) with Tt balancing
The high-level language instructions FFWON and FFWOF are used to activate and deactivate feedforward control for specific channels on all axes.
To prevent feedforward control from being affected by these instructions on individual axes, you can define that it is always activated or always deactivated in machine data FFW_ACTIVATION_MODE (see also FFW_ACTIVATION_MODE).

If a feedforward control mode is selected (speed or torque feedforward control), MD32630 $MA_FFW_ACTIVATION_MODE can be used to program in addition whether feedforward control can be activated or deactivated by the part program.

<brief>Activate feedforward control from program</brief>
<description>MD32630 $FFW_ACTIVATION_MODE can be used to define whether the feedforward control for this axis/spindle can be switched on and off by the part program.

0 =	The feedforward control cannot be switched on or off by the high-level language elements FFWON and FFWOF respectively.
	For the axis/spindle, the state specified by MD32620 $MA_FFW_MODE is therefore always effective.
1 =	The feedforward control can be switched on and off by the part program with FFWON and FFWOF respectively.
	The instruction FFWON/FFWOF becomes active immediately
2 =	The feedforward control can be switched on and off by the part program with FFWON and FFWOF respectively.
	The instruction FFWON/FFWOF does not become active until the next axis standstill

The default setting is specified by the channel-specific MD20150 $MC_GCODE_RESET_VALUES. This setting is valid even before the first NC block is executed.
Notes:
The last valid state continues to be active even after Reset (and therefore also with JOG).
As the feedforward control of all axes of the channel is switched on and off by FFWON and FFWOF respectively, MD32630 $MA_FFW_ACTIVATION_MODE should be set identically for axes interpolating with one naother.
Switching feedforward control on or off while the axis/spindle is traversing may cause compensation operations in the control loop. Interpolating axes are therefore stopped by the part program if such switching operations occur (internal stop Stop G09 is triggered).

<description>Only with SINAMICS:
Inertia of axis. Used for torque feedforward control.

With torque feedforward control, an additional current setpoint proportional to the torque is directly injected at the input of the current controller. This value is formed using the acceleration and the moment of inertia. The equivalent time constant of the current control loop must be defined for this purpose and entered in MD32800 $MA_EQUIV_CURRCTRL_TIME.
The total moment of inertia of the axis (drive + load) must also be entered in MD32650 $MA_AX_INERTIA (total moment of inertia referred to motor shaft according to data supplied by machine manufacturer).
When MD32650 $MA_AX_INERTIA and MD32800 $MA_EQUIV_CURRCTRL_TIME are set correctly, the following error is almost zero even during acceleration (check this by looking at the "following error" in the service display).
The torque feedforward control is deactivated if MD32650 $MA_AX_INERTIA is set to 0. However, because the calculations are performed anyway, torque feedforward control must always be deactivated with MD32620 $MA_FFW_MODE = 0 or 1 or 3 (recommended). Because of the direct current setpoint injection, torque feedforward control is only possible on digital drives.

<description>The maximum distance that can be traversed because of temperature compensation in one IPO cycle can be limited by the axial MD32760 $MA_COMP_ADD_VELO_FACTOR.
If the resulting temperature compensation value is above this maximum, it is traversed over several IPO cycles. There is no alarm.
The maximum compensation value per IPO cycle is specified as a factor referring to the maximum axis velocity (MD32000 $MA_MAX_AX_VELO).
The maximum gradient of the temperature compensation tanbmax is also limited with this machine data.
Example of calculation of the maximum gradient tanb(max):
1.	Calculation of the interpolator cycle time (see Description of Functions Velocities, Setpoint/Actual Value Systems, Cycle Times (G2))
	Interpolator cycle time = Basic system clock rate * factor for interpolation cycle
	Interpolator cycle time = MD10050 $MN_SYSCLOCK_CYCLE_TIME ^ MD10070 $MN_IPO_SYSCLOCK_TIME_RATIO
	Example:
	MD10050 $MN_SYSCLOCK_CYCLE_TIME = 0.004 [s]
	MD10070 $MN_IPO_SYSCLOCK_TIME_RATIO = 3
	-&gt; Interpolator cycle time = 0.004 * 3 = 0.012 [s]
2.	Calculation of the maximum velocity increase resulting from a change made to the temperature compensation parameter DvTmax

	DvTmax = MD32000 $MA_MAX_AX_VELO * MD32760 $MA_COMP_ADD_VELO_FACTOR

	Example: MD32000 $MA_MAX_AX_VELO = 10 000 [mm/min]

	     -&gt; DvTmax = 10 000 * 0.01 = 100 [mm/min]

3.	Calculation of the traverse distances per interpolator cycle

                                     0.012
     S1 (at vmax)      = 10 000 x  --------- = 2.0 [mm]

                                      0.012
     ST (at DvTmax) =       100 x  --------- = 0.02 [mm]
                                        60
4.	Calculation of tanbmax
                         ST      0.02
             tanbmax  =  ----  = ------  = 0.01 (corresponds to value for
                         S1        2               COMP_ADD_VELO_FACTOR)

	With larger values of SD43910 $SA_TEMP_COMP_SLOPE, the maximum gradient (here 0.57 degrees) for the position-dependent temperature compensation value is used internally. There is no alarm.

- Absolute encoder:
MD34090 $MA_REFP_MOVE_DIST_CORR acts as an absolute offset.
It describes the offset between the machine zero and the zero point of the absolute measuring system.

Note:
In conjunction with absolute encoders, this MD is modified by the control during calibration processes and modulo offset.
With rotary absolute encoders (on linear and rotary axes), the modification frequency also depends on the setting of MD34220 $MA_ENC_ABS_TURNS_MODULO.
Manual input or modification of this MD via the part program should therefore be followed by a Power ON Reset to activate the new value and prevent it from being lost.

The following applies to an NCU-LINK:
If a link axis uses an absolute encoder, every modification of MD34090 $MA_REFP_MOVE_DIST_CORR on the home NCU (servo physically available) is updated only locally and not beyond the limits of the NCU. The modification is therefore not visible to the link axis. Writing MD34090 $MA_REFP_MOVE_DIST_CORR through the link axis is rejected with alarm 17070.

<brief>Electronic cam offset for incremental measuring systems</brief>
<description>Electronic cam offset for incremental measuring systems with equidistant zero marks.

When the reference cam signal occurs, the zero mark search does not start immediately but is delayed until after the distance from REFP_CAM_SHIFT.
This ensures the reproducibility of the zero mark search through a defined selection of a zero mark, even with temperature-dependent expansion of the reference cam.

Because the reference cam offset is calculated by the control in the interpolation cycle, the actual cam offset is at least REFP_CAM_SHIFT and at most REFP_CAM_SHIFT+(MD34040 $MA_REFP_VELO_SEARCH_MARKER*interpolation cycle)

The reference cam offset is effective in the search direction of the zero mark.

	Same meaning as bit 0 = 1, although the gear stage change is carried out in a configured spindle position (SW 5.3 and higher). The change position is configured in MD35012 $MA_GEAR_STEP_CHANGE_POSITION. The position is approached in the current gear stage before the gear stage change. If this bit is set, bit 0 is not taken into account!

Bit 2: Reserved

Bit 3 = 1:
	The gear stage change dialog between NCK and PLC is simulated. The setpoint gear stage is output to the PLC. A checkback signal from the PLC is not awaited. The acknowledgment is generated internally in the NCK.

Bit 4: Reserved

<brief>Encoder limit frequency for new encoder synchronization.</brief>
<description>Encoder frequency monitoring uses a hysteresis.
MD36300 $MA_ENC_FREQ_LIMIT defines the encoder limit frequency. The encoder is deactivated when this frequency is exceeded. The encoder is re-activated when the frequency falls below that defined in MD36302 $MA_ENC_FREQ_LIMIT_LOW.

MD36300 $MA_ENC_FREQ_LIMIT is entered directly in Hertz,
whereas MD36302 $MA_ENC_FREQ_LIMIT_LOW is a fraction, expressed as a percentage of MD36300 $MA_ENC_FREQ_LIMIT.
MD36302 $MA_ENC_FREQ_LIMIT_LOW is therefore already correctly preset for most of the encoders used.
Exception: In the case of absolute encoders with an En-Dat interface, the limit frequency of the absolute track is significantly lower than the limit frequency of the incremental track. A low value in MD36302 $MA_ENC_FREQ_LIMIT_LOW ensures that the encoder is not re-activated until it falls below the limit frequency of the absolute track, and therefore is not referenced until permitted by the absolute track. For spindles, this referencing is carried out automatically.

Example EnDat encoder EQN 1325:
Limit frequency of the electronics of the incremental track: 430 kHz
===&gt; MD36300 $MA_ENC_FREQ_LIMIT = 430 kHz
The limit frequency of the absolute track is approx. 2000 encoder rpm at 2048 increments/encoder revolution, i.e. the limit frequency is 2000/60 * 2048 Hz = 68 kHz

<brief>Maximum time for braking ramp in case of error.</brief>
<description>This MD defines the braking ramp time that an axis or spindle requires to brake from maximum velocity/speed to a standstill in the event of errors (e.g. EMERGENCY STOP). At the same lead/brake acceleration, standstill is reached correspondingly earlier from lower velocities/speeds.
Mechanically robust axes are normally stopped abruptly with speed setpoint 0; values in the lower ms range are appropriate in these cases (default setting).
However, high moving masses or limited mechanical conditions (e.g. gear load capacity) often have to be taken into account for spindles. This means that the MD has to be changed to set a longer braking ramp.

Notice:
- With interpolating axes or axis/spindle couplings, it cannot be ensured that the contour or coupling will be maintained during the braking phase.
- If the time set for the braking ramp for error states is too long, the controller enable will be removed although the axis/spindle is still moving. Depending on the drive type used and the activation of the pulse enable, either an immediate stop with speed setpoint 0 will be initiated or the axis/spindle will coast down without power. The time selected in MD36610 $MA_AX_EMERGENCY_STOP_TIME should therefore be shorter than the time in MD36620 $MA_SERVO_DISABLE_DELAY_TIME (cutout delay, controller enable) so that the configured braking ramp can be fully active throughout the entire braking operation.
- The braking ramp may be ineffective or not maintained if the active drive follows its own braking ramp logic (e.g. SINAMICS).

The delay time entered becomes active as a result of the following events:
- Errors that lead to immediate stopping of the axes
- Removal of the interface signal &lt;Reglerfreigabe/&gt; (Controller enable) from the PLC

As soon as the actual speed reaches the standstill range (MD36060 $MA_STANDSTILL_VELO_TOL), the "controller enable" for the drive is removed. The time set should be long enough to enable the axis / spindle to brake down to a standstill from maximum traversing velocity or maximum speed. If the axis / spindle is stationary, the "controller enable" for the drive is removed immediately (i.e. the time defined in MD36620 $MA_SERVO_DISABLE_DELAY_TIME is terminated prematurely).
Application example(s):
Speed control of the drive should be retained long enough to enable the axis / spindle to brake down to standstill from maximum traversing velocity or maximum speed.

Notice:
	If the cutout delay controller enable is set too short, controller enable will be removed although the axis/spindle is still moving. This axis/spindle then coasts down without power (which may be appropriate for grinding wheels, for example); otherwise the time set in MD36620 $MA_SERVO_DISABLE_DELAY_TIME should be longer than the duration of the braking ramp for error states (MD36610 $MA_AX_EMERGENCY_STOP_TIME).

<description>Only for special analog and hydraulic drives (not active with PROFIdrive drives):
The value entered in MD36720 $MA_DRIFT_VALUE is always added as an offset to the manipulated variable. Whereas automatic drift compensation is active only for position-controlled axes, this machine data is always active.

Special case: the following applies to PROFIdrive drives:
This MD can also be used for "simple" drives that have drift problems due to drive-internal implementation as analog drives. To avoid erroneous settings, this static drift compensation only becomes active with PROFIdrive if MD32250 $MA_RATED_OUTVAL != 0 (i.e. the MD has no effect in the case of automatic interface adjustment between the NC and the drive).

Note:
	Drift compensation must not be active if the DSC function (MD32640 $MA_STIFFNESS_CONTROL_ENABLE=1) is being used, otherwise unexpected speed oscillations will occur when DSC is enabled/disabled.

Standardization: The input value is related to the corresponding interface standardization in

	With gantry axes, the difference between the actual position values of the leading and synchronized axes is constantly monitored.

	MD37110 $MA_GANTRY_POS_TOL_WARNING is used to define a limit value for the actual position value difference; when the limit is exceeded, warning 10652 "Warning limit exceeded" is output. However, the gantry axes are not stopped internally in the control. The warning threshold must therefore be selected so that the machine can withstand the actual position value deviation between the gantry axes without sustaining mechanical damage.

	Furthermore, the NC/PLC interface signal &lt;Gantry-Warngrenze_ueberschritten/&gt; (Gantry warning limit exceeded) to the PLC is set to "1". The PLC user program can thus initiate the necessary measures (e.g. program interruption at block end) when the warning limit is exceeded.

	As soon as the actual current position value difference has dropped below the warning limit again, the message is canceled and the interface signal "Gantry warning limit exceeded" is reset.

	Effect of the gantry warning limit on the gantry synchronization process:

	The actual position value difference between the leading and synchronized axes is determined during gantry synchronization. If the deviation is less than the gantry warning limit, the synchronizing motion of the gantry axes is automatically started internally in the control.

	Otherwise the synchronizing motion has to be initiated via the PLC interface (interface signal &lt;Gantry-Synchronisationslauf_starten/&gt; (Start gantry synchronization process))

Furthermore, this threshold value can be used to define the criterion for block change on activation of synchronous mode or on modification of the speed ratio parameters when the coupling is active in cases where "synchronism coarse" is selected as the block change response condition (see channel-specific MD21320 $MC_COUPLE_BLOCK_CHANGE_CTRL_1 or language instruction COUPDEF, WAITC, CPBC).

Entering a value of "0" always sets the NC/PLC interface signal &lt;Synchronlauf_grob/&gt; "synchronism coarse" to "1" in DV/AV mode or with cmd/actpos.

<name>PROFIBUS_TORQUE_RED_RESOL</name>
<brief>Resolution PROFIdrive torque reduction</brief>
<description>For PROFIdrive only:
Resolution of torque reduction on the PROFIdrive (LSB significance)

The MD is only relevant for controls with PROFIdrive drives. For these controls, it defines the resolution of the cyclic interface data "Torque reduction value" (only exists for MD13060 $MN_DRIVE_TELEGRAM_TYPE = 101 ff. or 201 ff.), which is required for the "Travel to fixed stop" functionality.

The 1% default value corresponds to the original significance. The torque limit is transferred on the PROFIdrive with increments of 1%; the value 100 in the corresponding PROFIdrive message frame data cell corresponds to full torque reduction (i.e. without force).

By changing this MD to 0.005%, for example, the value can be entered in increments of 0.005%, i.e. the increments for the torque limit value become finer by a factor of 200.
For limitation to the rated torque, the value 0 is transmitted in this case; complete torque reduction (i.e. without force) characterizes the transmittable value 10000.
To avoid misadaptation, the setting value of the MD must be selected to match the interpretation configured on the drive side or the firmly defined interpretation of the torque reduction value. If the setting of the control on the drive (manufacturer-specific drive parameter) is known (i.e. with SIEMENS drives), the software automatically sets the MD; in other words, in this case the MD is merely used for display purposes.

<name>MM_ENC_COMP_MAX_POINTS</name>
<brief>Number of intermediate points for interpol. compensation (SRAM)</brief>
<description>The number of interpolation points required per measuring system must be defined for the leadscrew error compensation.
The required number can be calculated as follows using the defined parameters:
                                     $AA_ENC_COMP_MAX - $AA_ENC_COMP_MIN
MD38000 $MA_MM_ENC_COMP_MAX_POINTS = ----------------------------------  + 1
                                               $AA_ENC_COMP_STEP

	$AA_ENC_COMP_MIN     Initial position (system variable)
	$AA_ENC_COMP_MAX     End position (system variable)
	$AA_ENC_COMP_STEP    Distance between interpolation points (system variable)

When selecting the number of interpolation points and/or the distances between them, it is important to take into account the size of the resulting compensation table and the space required in the buffered NC user memory (SRAM). 8 bytes are required for each compensation value (interpolation point).
The index [n] has the following coding: [encoder no.]: 0 or 1

Special cases:                      Notice:
	After any change in MD38000 $MA_MM_ENC_COMP_MAX_POINTS, the buffered NC user memory is automatically re-allocated on system power-on.
	All data in the buffered NC user memory are then lost (e.g. part programs, tool offsets etc.). Alarm 6020 "Machine data changed - memory reallocated" is output.
	If reallocation of the NC user memory fails because the total memory capacity available is insufficient, alarm 6000 "Memory allocation made with standard machine data" is output.
	In this case, the NC user memory division is allocated using the default values of the standard machine data.

<name>MM_QEC_MAX_POINTS</name>
<brief>Number of values for quadrant error compens. with neural network</brief>
<description>In quadrant error compensation with neural networks (QEC), the number of compensation values required has to be entered for each axis that is to be compensated.

The required number can be calculated as follows using the defined parameters: MD38010 $MA_MM_QEC_MAX_POINTS _ ($AA_QEC_COARSE_STEPS + 1) ^ $AA_QEC_FINE_STEPS

$AA_QEC_COARSE_STEPS     Coarse quantization of the characteristic (system variable)
$AA_QEC_FINE_STEPS       Fine quantization of the characteristic (system variable)

For "direction-dependent" compensation, the number must be greater than or equal to double the value of this product.

When selecting coarse or fine quantization, the resulting size of the compensation table and its memory requirement in the buffered user memory must be taken into account. 4 bytes are required for each compensation value. If the value 0 is entered, no memory is reserved for the table; i.e. the table does not exist and the function cannot therefore be activated.

Special cases:                     Caution!

	If MD38010 $MA_MM_QEC_MAX_POINTS is altered, the buffered NC user memory is automatically re-allocated on system power-on. This deletes all the user data in the buffered user memory (e.g. drive and HMI machine data, code, tool offsets, part programs etc.).

Note:
	For better handling, a large number should be chosen initially, because the exact number of interpolation points that are required is not known when the compensation is started for the first time. This number can be reduced to the required size as soon as the characteristics have been recorded and saved. After performing another power-on, the saved characteristics can be reloaded.
