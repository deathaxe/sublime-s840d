<name>SAFE_PULSE_DIS_TIME_BUSFAIL</name>
<brief>Delay time pulse suppr. for bus failure</brief>
<description>Time after a communication failure with the drive at which safe pulse disable takes place. The drive can still respond autonomously to the bus failure during this time (see extended stop and retract)

In the following cases, this time is not allowed to elapse before disabling pulses:

- On selection of an external Stop A or a test stop
- If SBH is active or on selection of SBH
- If an SG level is active or on selection of an SG level for which an immediate pulse disable is parameterized in MD36961 $MA_SAFE_VELO_STOP_MODE or MD36963 $MA_SAFE_VELO_STOP_REACTION.

Note:
This value is transferred to the drive parameter p9580 with the copy function of the SI-MD and compared in the data cross-check. This general machine data is contained in the axis-specific checksum calculation of the safety-related machine data (MD36998 $MA_SAFE_ACT_CHECKSUM, MD36999 $MA_SAFE_DES_CHECKSUM).

<brief>Factor for monitoring cycle</brief>
<description>Ratio between the monitoring cycle and the system clock cycle. The monitoring cycle is the product of this data and MD10050 $MN_SYSCLOCK_CYCLE_TIME.

The monitoring cycle is checked during power on:
-  It must be an integer multiple of the position-control cycle
-  It must be &lt; 25 ms

The factor is rounded down to the next possible value if the conditions are not fulfilled. The actual set monitoring cycle is displayed by MD10091 $MN_INFO_SAFETY_CYCLE_TIME.

A new value is also generated for the cross-check cycle, which is displayed by data MD10092 $MN_INFO_CROSSCHECK_CYCLE_TIME.

Note:
The monitoring cycle defines the monitoring response time. It must be noted that the CPU load increases as the monitoring cycle becomes shorter.

<description>Affects the display of safety alarms. The monitoring channels NCK and drive or NCK and PLC display alarms with the same meaning in several situations.
To reduce the volume of the alarm display, this MD is set to define whether safety alarms with the same meaning are to be hidden or not. This does not affect the dual-channel stop response.
0 = Dual-channel triggered alarms are displayed in full
- Dual-channel display of all axis-specific safety alarms
- Alarm 27001, error code 0 is displayed

In the case of these alarms, only one of the alarms listed (270xx or C01xxx) is triggered.
The alarm of the monitoring channel that triggers the alarm with the same meaning at a later time is no longer displayed.
Furthermore, alarm 27001 with error code 0 is suppressed. This alarm is triggered as a result of drive alarm C01711. In this case, drive parameters r9710[0,1], r9711[0,1], r9735[0,1], r9736[0,1], r9737[0,1], r9738[0,1], r9739[0,1] provide further information about the cause of the error.

In addition to the functionality with MD value = 1, the alarms from SPL processing (27090, 27091, 27092, 27093, and 27095) are displayed in one channel and only once. This also applies to the alarms for PROFIsafe communication (27250 and following).
3 = Axis-specific alarms 27000 and A01797 are replaced by alarm message 27100 for all axes / drives. Alarm 27040 is replaced by alarm 27140 for all axes/ drives.
12 = The alarms are prioritized beyond the functionality with MD value = 2. Obvious subsequent alarms are no longer displayed or are automatically cleared from the display.

1xx (100 digit set) = Axis-specific checksum alarms of the NCK (27032, 27035, and 27060) are displayed in SPL setup mode (MD11500 $MN_PREVENT_SYNACT_LOCK[0,1] = 0) by alarm 27135 for all axes.

This machine data must be set to 0 to create an acceptance log, so that the triggering of all alarms can be logged.

Entering the value 4 in this MD (Stop E), without external Stop E being enabled in all axes with SI function enable (MD36901 $MA_SAFE_FUNCTION_ENABLE not equal to 0), results in alarm 27033 with a reference to this MD.
As a remedy, either Stop D must be parameterized again, or bits 4 and 6 must be set in MD36901 $MA_SAFE_FUNCTION_ENABLE for all affected axes.
If this MD is set to 4, the PLC signal &lt;Stop_E/&gt; (Stop E) must also be set to 1 to make this parameterization known to the PLC. Different parameterization results in alarm 27090.
