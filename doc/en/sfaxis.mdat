<brief>Enable safety functions</brief>
<description>The safe operation functions can be enabled for an axis/spindle with this data.
For each axis, only as many axes/spindles can be enabled for safe operation as are enabled by the global option.
The more subfunctions are set, the more CPU time the safety functions need.

Bit  0: Enables safe velocity, safe operational stop
Bit  1: Enables safe limit switches
Bit  2: Reserved for functions with absolute references (such as SE/SN)

Bit 15: Enables safe cams, pair 4, cam -
Bit 16: Enables synchronization "n &lt; nx", hysteresis and filtering
Bit 23: Enables deactivation of SBH/SG monitoring during external stop A

Special cases:
- When one of the bits from bit 1 is set, bit 0 also has to be set because the control switches to safe operational stop with STOP C, D, E (parameterization alarm 27033 is displayed if there is an error).
- If the global option does not enable enough axes/spindles for safe operation, then this data can be overwritten with the value 0 during runup.

<description>Weighting factors for determining the setpoint velocity limit.
The active weighting factor is selected via the axis-specific NC/PLC interface &lt;SG-Sollwertbegrenzung/&gt; .

Parameterization:
To set this MD optimally, it may be necessary to make a number of changes to take the dynamic performance of the drives into account.

Effect of SI monitoring with NCK involvement:
- When 0% is entered, the setpoint velocity limit is inactive.
- When 100% is entered, the setpoint is limited to the active SG stage.
- The active actual velocity limit is weighted with the selected factor, and specified to the interpolator as the setpoint limit.
- If SBH is selected, setpoint 0 is specified.
- This data is not included in the cross-check with the drive.
- This data is not included in the axis-specific checksum MD36998 $MA_SAFE_ACT_CHECKSUM[], as it involves a 1-channel function.

Effect of drive-autonomous SI monitoring:
- The precondition is that the connection has been activated in the NCK via SIC (MD37950 $MA_SAFE_INFO_ENABLE, bit 0).
- When 0% is entered, the NCK influence on the setpoint limit is inactive. The setpoint limit corresponds to the value read from the drive via SIC.
- When values &gt; 0% are entered, the NCK influence on the setpoint velocity limit is active. It affects the setpoint limit read from the drive via SIC.
- The value read from the drive via SIC is weighted with the selected factor, and specified to the interpolator as the setpoint limit.
- The parameterizable setpoint limit in the drive (p9533) is active independently of the NCK limit.

Special cases:
- If the PLC user program does not contain any settings for selecting the weighting factor, the MD value from MD36933 $MA_SAFE_DES_VELO_LIMIT[0] applies.

If, with activated safe cams (MD36901 $MA_SAFE_FUNCTION_ENABLE), the actual position is greater than this value, the corresponding safety-related output signal (SGA) is set to 1. If the actual position falls below this value, the SGA is set to 0.

n = 0, 1, 2, 3 stand for minus cam positions of SN1 -, SN2 -, SN3 -, SN4 -

The following applies to the function "Safe cam track":
If the function "Safe cam track" has been enabled (MD36903 $MA_SAFE_CAM_ENABLE), the safety-related output signals "Cam track" and "Cam range" are set in accordance with the parameterization in MD36938 $MA_SAFE_CAM_TRACK_ASSIGN[n].
n = 0 ... 29 stand for minus cam positions of SN1-, SN2-, ..., SN30-.

<description>Assignment of the individual cams to the max. 4 cam tracks including definition of the numerical value for SGA "Cam range".

&gt;The hundreds digit defines to which cam track the cam is assigned. Valid values are 1, 2, 3 or 4.
The tens and ones digits include the numerical value that is to be reported to the safe logics as SGA "Cam range" and processed there. Valid values are 0 to 14, while each numerical value per cam track may be used only once.

Therefore the valid value range of this machine data is:
100...114, 200...214, 300...314, 400...414

Examples:
MD36938 $MA_SAFE_CAM_TRACK_ASSIGN[0] = 207: cam 1 (index 0) is assigned to cam track 2.
If the position is within the range of this cam, a 7 is entered in SGA "Cam range" of the 2nd cam track.
MD36938 $MA_SAFE_CAM_TRACK_ASSIGN[5] = 100: cam 6 (index 5) is assigned to cam track 1.

<brief>Tolerance actual value check (referencing)</brief>
<description>This data defines the tolerance for checking the actual values after referencing (for an incremental encoder) or during power-on (for an absolute encoder).
Referencing determines an absolute actual position of the axis. A second absolute actual position is derived from the last stored standstill position before the control was switched off and the path traversed since power-on. The control checks the actual values after referencing with these two absolute positions, the path traversed and this data.

The following influences must be taken into account when determining the tolerance values:
backlash, leadscrew error, compensations (max. compensation values with LEC, sag and temperature compensation), temperature errors, torsion (2-encoder system), gear tolerance in variable gears, coarser resolution (2-encoder system), oscillation distance with variable gears.

Note:
If the two absolute actual positions differ by more than the value in this data when the user enable is given, alarm 27001 is displayed with error code 1003, and a new user enable is required for referencing.

This data defines the length of time after SGE switchovers during which the actual values and the monitoring results are not cross-checked (the machine data continue to be compared!). The selected monitoring continues to run uninterrupted in both monitoring channels.

A safe function becomes active in a monitoring channel as soon as the selection or switchover is detected in this channel.

The differing runtime is mainly determined by the PLC cycle time.

<name>SAFE_STANDSTILL_DELAY</name>
<brief>Delay time switchover to SBH / SG</brief>
<description>If a standstill is detected during the switch to safe operating stop or a lower Safely Limited Speed level (see MD 37920 $MA_SAFE_STANDSTILL_VELO_LIMIT), then SOS or the selected SLS level becomes active no later than after this transition time. In this case, the transition times of stops C, D, and E as well as SLS after SOS or a higher or lower SLS level are cancelled or replaced by this delay time.
